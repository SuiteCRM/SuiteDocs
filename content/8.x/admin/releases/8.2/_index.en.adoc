==== icon:star[] Enhancements

Following on from the previous SuiteCRM 8.2 beta release, we have continued to work on new features and improved functionality which you will find to follow;

==== LDAP and SAML Authentication
Authentication with LDAP and SAML has been added, to make it easier to access SuiteCRM by using the same credentials that you may use to access other applications.

To see how to setup and configure the authentication methods, please see the following documentation:

** link:../../../../8.x/admin/configuration/ldap-configuration/[LDAP Setup and Configuration]
** link:../../../../8.x/admin/configuration/saml-configuration/[SAML Setup and Configuration]

==== History Timeline
When viewing the History timeline, you are now able to click on an entry to view the related record’s detail:

==== History and Activity Subpanel Icons
Icons have been added to both the History and Activity subpanels to show which module a record is associated with:

==== Duplicate View
When duplicating a record, you will now see the ‘Create’ page for that module:

==== Top Widget Changes`
Previously when viewing the top widgets, if there is no information the ‘-’ character would be displayed.  This has now been changed to make it clear there is no  information to display, e.g.

==== Graphql API
Previously when navigating to ‘http://myhost/index.php#/accounts’ or ‘http://myhost/#/accounts’, the API calls always pointed to ‘http://myhost/api/graphql’ incorrectly.
We have therefore updated this to ensure the Graphql calls point to the correct location pathname instead.

==== Bulk Select Subpanel
When viewing a subpanel, the Link option has replaced the Select option from the actions drop down. Similar to the Select option, this option will display a pop-up window where one or more records can be selected, to associate with the parent record.
