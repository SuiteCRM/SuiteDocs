==== icon:code[] Backward Incompatible Changes


===== 1. Default extension renamed to defaultExt
{{% notice warning %}}
The 'extensions/default' package has been renamed to 'extensions/defaultExt'.
{{% /notice %}}

The upgrade process does not remove the old `extensions/default` package. Any changes on it should be manually moved to the `extensions/defaultExt`.

The `extensions/default` is going to be removed in a future version.

===== 2. DisplayType logic moved to displayLogic

The `displayType` logic within the metadata `logic` entry has been deprecated. This will be removed in a future version.

There is a now a more flexible metadata entry that should be used, named `displayLogic`. See link:../../../developer/extensions/frontend/logic/field-logic/fe-extensions-display-logic/[Field Display Logic] guide for more information.
