== Projects

In SuiteCRM the Projects module allows the User to arrange their
organisation's projects by tracking a number of Tasks and allocating
resources. Once set up, a project can be visualised in the form of a
Gantt chart or using the project grid.

=== Projects Actions

You can access the Projects actions from the Projects module menu drop
down or via the Sidebar once you have clicked to view the module. The
Projects actions are as follows:

create a new Project record.
* *View Project* – Redirects you to the List View for the Projects module.
This allows you to search and list Project records.
* *View Project Tasks* – Allows you to list Project Tasks, which are
related to a parent Project.

module. For more information, see link:./../../introduction/user-interface/#_importing_records[Importing Records].
