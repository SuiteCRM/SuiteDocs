===== Usability improvements

====== 1. Quick Save / Search

* *On ListView Filter Panel:*
** Hitting `Enter` will apply the currently defined criteria and the search.
** When saving a filter, hitting `Enter` will save the filter and search.
* **On Record View: ** When creating/ editing records, hitting `ctrl`+`Enter` calls the record save.

====== 2. Date fields will now show the pop-up calendar when click on the input like they do when the calendar icon is clicked.

====== 3. Listview Column Resizing

* In order to show more rows on the screen, the ListView column padding has been reduced and the column width has been set to dynamically adjust.

====== 4. Enum component is now using regular dropdowns instead of the chips component

====== 5. Relate field component has been re-implemented
