== Supported Versions

Each release of SuiteCRM is supported for a pre-defined period of time after its initial stable release. During this period, bugs and security issues that have been reported are fixed and are released in regular maintenance releases.

After the support period ends, for ESR (Extended Support Release) releases, there is a security support period. Releases during this period are made on an as-needed basis: there can be several security fix releases, or none, depending on the number of reports.
