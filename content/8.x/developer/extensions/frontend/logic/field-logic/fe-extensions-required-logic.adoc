== 1. Introduction

Required logic allows you to define rules to mark fields as required depending on other fields values.

=== 1.1 Example scenario

In this example, using the Accounts module, we are going to require the field Annual Revenue if the Employees field is
between 10-50.

== 2. Logic Metadata definition

The first thing to define is the `logic` entry in the metadata. This is where we are going to define the triggers to mark our field as required.

The configuration for the logic can be added to the `vardefs.php` or the `detailviewdefs.php`.

In the following example we are going to add them to the `Accounts` module field vardefs.

=== 2.1 Steps to add the logic on the custom vardefs

. Create a new field in custom extensions for Accounts module:
.. Example:  `public/legacy/custom/Extension/modules/Accounts/Ext/Vardefs/annual_revenue.php`
. Copy the 'annual_revenue' definition from `public/legacy/include/SugarObjects/templates/company/vardefs.php`
. Replace the `logic` entry to the  `annual_revenue` definition with the code on the snippet below.
** Re-set permissions if needed (will depend on your setup)
. Run `Repair and Rebuild` on Admin menu

[source,php]
----
<?php

$dictionary['Account']['fields']['annual_revenue'] = array(
    'name' => 'annual_revenue',
    'vname' => 'LBL_ANNUAL_REVENUE',
    'type' => 'varchar',
    'len' => 100,
    'comment' => 'Annual revenue for this company',
    'merge_filter' => 'enabled',
    'logic' => [
        'required' => [
            'key' => 'required',
            'modes' => ['edit', 'create'],
            'params' => [
                'fieldDependencies' => [
                    'employees'
                ],
                'activeOnFields' => [
                    'employees' => [
                        '10-50'
                    ],
                ],
            ],
        ]
    ],
);
----

=== Required Logic

Within `logic` for specific fields you can set multiple definitions for `required`. Each definition will work like an `OR`.
For example:

[source,php]
----
    'logic' => [
        'required' => [
            'key' => 'required',
            'modes' => ['edit', 'create'],
            'params' => [
                'fieldDependencies' => [
                    'employees'
                ],
                'activeOnFields' => [
                    'employees' => [
                        '10-50'
                    ],
                ],
            ],
        ],
        // OR
        'required1' => [
            'key' => 'required',
            'modes' => ['edit', 'create'],
            'params' => [
                'fieldDependencies' => [
                    'name'
                ],
                'activeOnFields' => [
                    'name' => [
                        'Example'
                    ],
                ],
            ],
        ],
    ],
----

Now the Annual Revenue field will be `required` if the Name is example OR Employees is 10-50.

=== Properties description

* Key
- The `key` within the named `logic` array is stating which logic type will be used for the following.
In this case it's `required`.

* Modes
- Modes are views you would like your `required` logic to take effect on, as shown above it will be `detail`, `edit` and `create`.
Another example of a `mode` that could be selected could be `list` for example.

==== Params

===== Field Dependencies
`fieldDependencies` is where you declare the field(s) that you would like your logic to depend on.

[source,php]
----
'fieldDependencies' => [
    'employees',
]
----

==== Active on Fields

`activeOnFields` is where you declare the field/values that trigger the change of the field to a required field.

In the example above we have the field `annual_revenue` set to required when Employees is `10-50`.

If we wanted it to set it to required if it was either `10-50` or another value such as `50-100` then a new value would be added like so:

[source,php]
----
'activeOnFields' => [
  'employees' => ['10-50', '50-100'],
],
----

image:Required-Annual-Revenue-Field-Employees50-100.png[50-100 Employees]

===== Multiple Fields

Within the `activeonFields` you can add more than one field such as:

[source,php]
----
'activeOnFields' => [
    'employees' => ['10-50', '50-100'],
    'name' => ['Example'],
],
----

This works like an OR. If Name is `Example` OR Website is either `www.google.com` or `www.yahoo.com`.
When adding more fields to `activeOnFields` be sure to also add them to `fieldDependencies`
