== 1. Update Field Value Based on Another Field

In this exmaple we are going to use field logic to:

**Update the value of a field based on another field**

In this example we will be updating the value of Accounts Employees depending on the values of Industry.

== 2. How does this look as Code?

----
<?php
...

    'name' => 'employees',
    'comment' => 'Number of employees, varchar to accomodate for both number (100) or range (50-100)',
    'label' => 'LBL_EMPLOYEES',
    'logic' => [
        'update-value' => [
            'key' => 'updateValue',
            'modes' => ['detail', 'edit', 'create'],
            'params' => [
                'fieldDependencies' => [
                    'industry',
                ],
                'targetValue' => '450',
                'activeOnFields' => [
                    'industry' => ['Banking'],
                ]
            ]
        ],
    ]

...
----

When adding this configuration, it can be added to the `vardefs.php` or the `detailviewdefs.php`.

When adding this code be sure to add it below the field name and label as shown above.

=== Update Field Value Logic

Within `logic` for specific fields you can set multiple definitions for `update-value`. Each definition will work like an `OR`.
For example:

----
<?php
...

    'name' => 'employees',
    'comment' => 'Number of employees, varchar to accomodate for both number (100) or range (50-100)',
    'label' => 'LBL_EMPLOYEES',
    'logic' => [
        'update-value' => [
            'key' => 'updateValue',
            'modes' => ['detail', 'edit', 'create'],
            'params' => [
                'fieldDependencies' => [
                    'industry',
                ],
                'targetValue' => '450',
                'activeOnFields' => [
                    'industry' => ['Banking'],
                ]
            ]
        ],
        // OR
        'update-value2' => [
            'key' => 'updateValue',
            'modes' => ['detail', 'edit', 'create'],
            'params' => [
                'fieldDependencies' => [
                    'industry',
                ],
                'targetValue' => '5000',
                'activeOnFields' => [
                    'industry' => ['Media'],
                ]
            ]
        ],
    ]

...

Now, Employees will update to 450 if the Industry is `Banking` OR 5000 if Industry is `Media`.

=== Properties description

* Key
- The `key` within the named `logic` array is stating which logic type will be used for the following.
In this case it's `updateValue`.

* Modes
- Modes are views you would like your `updateValue` logic to take effect on, as shown above it will be `detail`, `edit` and `create`.
Another example of a `mode` that could be selected could be `list` for example.

==== Params

===== Field Dependencies

`fieldDependencies` is where you declare the field(s) that you would like your logic to depend on.

----

<?php

...
'fieldDependencies' => [
    'industry',
]

...

----

==== Active on Fields

`activeOnFields` is where you declare the field/values that trigger the change of the field to a required field.

In the example above we have the field `employees` set to 450 when Industry is Banking.

If we wanted it to set it to 450 if it was either Banking or another value such as Media, then a new value would be added like so:

----
<?php
...
'activeOnFields' => [
  'industry' => ['Banking', 'Media'],
],
...
----

===== Multiple Fields

Within the `activeonFields` you can add more than one field such as:

----
<?php
...

'activeOnFields' => [
    'industry' => ['Banking'],
    'name' => ['Example'],
],

...
----

This works like an AND. If Name is `Example` AND Industry is `Banking`.

When adding more fields to `activeOnFields` be sure to also add them to `fieldDependencies`.

==== Target Value

`targetValue` will be the value you want the field to have if criteria is met.

In the example above it was `450`.
