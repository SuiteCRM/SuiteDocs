SuiteCRM can assist Users with productivity, offering a way to record,
relate and assign Tasks and to-do items that require action.

== Tasks Actions

You can access the Tasks actions from the Tasks module menu drop down or
via the Sidebar. The Tasks actions are as follows:

* *Create Task* – A new form is opened in Edit View to allow you to create
a new Task record.
* *View Tasks* – Redirects you to the List View for the Tasks module. This
allows you to search and list Task records.
* *Import Tasks* – Redirects you to the Import Wizard for the Tasks
module. For more information, see link:./../../introduction/user-interface/#_importing_records[Importing Records].
