== 1. Example of Required Field Logic

In this example we are going to see how to add field logic in order to mark a field as required depending on another field value

In this example, using the Accounts module, we are going to require the field Annual Revenue if the Employees field is
between 10-50.

== 2. How does this look as Code?

----
<?php
...

    'name' => 'annual_revenue',
    'comment' => 'Annual revenue for this company',
    'label' => 'LBL_ANNUAL_REVENUE',
    'logic' => [
        'required' => [
            'key' => 'required',
            'modes' => ['edit', 'create'],
            'params' => [
                'fieldDependencies' => [
                    'employees'
                ],
                'activeOnFields' => [
                    'employees' => [
                        '10-50'
                    ],
                ],
            ],
        ]
    ],

...

When adding this configuration, it can be added to the `vardefs.php` or the `detailviewdefs.php`.

When adding this code be sure to add it below the field name and label as shown above.

=== Required Logic

Within `logic` for specific fields you can set multiple definitions for `required`. Each definition will work like an `OR`.
For example:

----
<?php
...

    'logic' => [
        'required' => [
            'key' => 'required',
            'modes' => ['edit', 'create'],
            'params' => [
                'fieldDependencies' => [
                    'employees'
                ],
                'activeOnFields' => [
                    'employees' => [
                        '10-50'
                    ],
                ],
            ],
        ],
        // OR
        'required1' => [
            'key' => 'required',
            'modes' => ['edit', 'create'],
            'params' => [
                'fieldDependencies' => [
                    'name'
                ],
                'activeOnFields' => [
                    'name' => [
                        'Example'
                    ],
                ],
            ],
        ],
    ],

...
----

Now the Annual Revenue field will be `required` if the Name is example OR Employees is 10-50.

=== Properties description

* Key
- The `key` within the named `logic` array is stating which logic type will be used for the following.
In this case it's `required`.

* Modes
- Modes are views you would like your `required` logic to take effect on, as shown above it will be `detail`, `edit` and `create`.
Another example of a `mode` that could be selected could be `list` for example.

==== Params

===== Field Dependencies
`fieldDependencies` is where you declare the field(s) that you would like your logic to depend on.

----

<?php

...
'fieldDependencies' => [
    'employees',
]

...

----

==== Active on Fields

`activeOnFields` is where you declare the field/values that trigger the change of the field to a required field.

In the example above we have the field `annual_revenue` set to required when Employees is `10-50`.

If we wanted it to set it to required if it was either `10-50` or another value such as `50-100` then a new value would be added like so:

----
<?php
...
'activeOnFields' => [
  'employees' => ['10-50', '50-100'],
],
...
----

image:Required-Annual-Revenue-Field-Employees50-100.png[50-100 Employees]

===== Multiple Fields

Within the `activeonFields` you can add more than one field such as:

----
<?php
...

'activeOnFields' => [
    'employees' => ['10-50', '50-100'],
    'name' => ['Example'],
],

...
----

This works like an OR. If Name is `Example` OR Website is either `www.google.com` or `www.yahoo.com`.
When adding more fields to `activeOnFields` be sure to also add them to `fieldDependencies`
