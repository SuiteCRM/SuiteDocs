= In-line Editing

In-line editing gives you the ability to change values “on the fly” and has been implemented on both List View and Detail View,
providing an advantage to users wishing to change field values quickly.

{{% notice note %}}
In-line editing can be enabled/disabled for both List View and
Detail View, via the main System Settings for the CRM by the System Administrator.
