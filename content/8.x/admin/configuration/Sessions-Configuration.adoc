== Option 1. Changing session dir in php.ini

It is possible to update the global session dir by changing php's link:https://www.php.net/manual/en/session.configuration.php#ini.session.save-path[session.save_path] directive on your php.ini file.


== Option 2. Changing session dir in SuiteCRM configuration

=== Change the session directory

This only applies to file based sessions
{{% /notice %}}

This guide explains how to configure SuiteCRM 8.x versions to store the sessions on a different folder

==== 1. Change the session_dir in legacy

On `public/legacy/config.php` or `public/legacy/config_override.php` change the `session_dir` to the new path.

Through the rest of this guide we are going to assume that we want to have our session files being stored in a `var/sessions` folder within your SuiteCRM 8 instance folder, like:
* `/<path-to-your-project>/var/sessions`

[source,php]
----
<?php
...
$sugar_config = array (
...

  'session_dir' => '/<path-to-your-suite8-project>/var/sessions',
  'session_gc' =>
  array (
    'enable' => true,
    'gc_probability' => 1,
    'gc_divisor' => 100,
  ),

==== 2. Change session save_path in SuiteCRM 8 configuration

Now we need to change the SuiteCRM 8 symfony configuration.
To add it to SuiteCRM 8 configuration in an extensible way you can add it to:
`extensions/<your-extension>/config/services/framework.yaml`

If you name your extension `custom` it would look something like.
`extensions/custom/config/services/framework.yaml`

[source,yaml]
----
framework:
  session:
    cookie_lifetime: null
    cookie_secure: auto
    cookie_samesite: lax
    gc_probability : 1
    gc_divisor : 100
    handler_id: session.handler.native_file
    save_path: '%kernel.project_dir%/var/sessions'

----

==== 3. Clear symfony cache

From your instance root folder run `bin/console cache:clear`

[source,bash]
----
bin/console cache:clear
----

If you don't have access to the terminal you can also delete the contents of: `/<path-to-your-project>/cache`

* Please make sure that `apache / php` **have access to write** to the `cache` folder
* **The above is not** the legacy cache folder. **Do not** delete the `/<path-to-your-project>/public/legacy/cache`
