== Defaults

By default SuiteCRM has login throttling enabled to trigger after `3` failed attempts.

If the user fails to login that number times in a row, a message will be displayed explaining that the max number of attempts has been reached.
The user will have to wait at least a minute before they can try to login again.

== Configuring the max number of attempts

The number of attempts is configured on the `LOGIN_THROTTLING_MAX_ATTEMPTS` .env property, which can be changed on the .env.local.

== More configurations and customizations

SuiteCRM is using Symfony's login throttling mechanism.
