===== icon:key[] Two-Factor Authentication

We have added 2FA on SuiteCRM 8. See more information link:../../../../8.x/features/two-factor/two-factor[here.]

===== icon:cog[] Record Mappers

Mappers run at 2 levels, Api level and Entity level.

Api level is called immediately *before* or *after* receiving or sending data to api.

Entity leve is called within Entity level operations, e.g.:

* retrieving a record
* saving a record
* etc...

Entity Mappers will run regardless if they are called from the API or elsewhere.

There are now 3 new types of mapper added for Entity and Api:

* Field Mapper
** Field Mapper is used to map a field on a module (e.g. `phone` on Accounts).
* Field Type Mapper
** Field Type Mapper is used to map field types specifically (e.g. `varchar` on Accounts).
* Record Mapper
** Record Mapper is used to map more than one field for module.

====== Record Mapper Modes

The above mappers are called on 3 different points; when retrieving a record, when saving a record and when getting a list of records.

You can configure your mapper to run on any or all of these 3 points for that you have to set the mode(s) for your mapper:

* retrieve
** the `toInternal` method is never called for this mode.
* list
** the `toInternal` method is never called for this mode.
* save

====== Record Mapper Order

When adding a new Record Mapper you will have the `getOrder` function to set the order/ priority in which the mappers run per mapper type.

====== Set and Replace Default Type

To set a default mapper for any of the mapper types, when adding the mapper return the key `default`.

When adding new mappers, if there is already a `default` set for that mapper type (field, field type and record),
and you wish to run a new mapper instead you will have to add:

[source, php]
    public function replaceDefaultTypeMapper(): bool
    {
        return true;
    }

This will run your new mapper and *not* run the default mapper.

===== Save Handlers

There are 3 different types of Save Handler:

* After Save
* Before Save
* Save (on Save)

The `Before Save` and `After Save` handler have similar logic to `before_save` and `after_save` logic hooks.

These 3 types of Save Handler can be used on each of the Record Mapper Types:

* Field
* Field Type
* Record

====== Replace Default Type

Similar to Record Mappers, Save Handlers have the ability to run a new mapper instead of the `default` if one is set.

==== icon:star[] Filtering on Favorites

You can now filter by `Favorites` and `My Items`.

==== icon:paint-brush[] Record View, Subpanel, Top Widget and Timeline Redesign

image:Full-View-871.png[8.7.1 Full View]

image:Full-View-880.png[8.8.0-beta Full View]

===== Record View

image:871-RecordView.png[8.7.1 Record View]

image:880-RecordView.png[8.8.0-beta Record View]

The fields within the record view now take up minimal space, allowing you to see the full record.

===== Subpanels

image:871-Subpanels.png[8.7.1 Subpanels]

image:880-Subpanels.png[8.8.0-beta Subpanels]

Subpanels are now more compact and show the number of records a subpanel has.

The number of subpanels that show when collapsed is configurable via the `subpanel_buttons_panel_limits.yaml`.

Although it is recommended to do these changes within `defaultExt` or alternatively your own extension.

===== Timeline

image:871-History-Timeline.png[8.7.1 History Timeline]

image:880-History-Timeline.png[8.8.0-beta History Timeline]

Following the other changes, the timeline is also more compact showing more information on the record without scrolling.

==== icon:cog[] Performance Upgrade

* Added a delay to non-critical backend calls such as; recently viewed, metadata, and notifications.
