= 13. Scheduled Tasks

== Intro

Scheduled tasks are performed in SuiteCRM by the scheduler module. Jobs
are placed into the queue either through the defined scheduled tasks or,
for one off tasks, by code creating job objects. Note that both
scheduled tasks and using the job queue requires that you have the
schedulers set up. This will vary depending on your system but usually
requires adding an entry either to Cron (for Linux systems) or to the
windows scheduled tasks (for windows). Opening the scheduled tasks page
within SuiteCRM will let you know the format for the entry.

== Scheduler

Scheduled tasks allow SuiteCRM to perform recurring tasks. Examples of
these which ship with SuiteCRM include checking for incoming mail,
sending email reminder notifications and indexing the full text search.
What if you want to create your own tasks?

SuiteCRM lets you define your own Scheduler. We do this by creating a
file in +
`custom/Extension/modules/Schedulers/Ext/ScheduledTasks/`. 

You can give this file a name of your choice but it is more helpful to give it a
descriptive name. Let’s create a simple file named +
`custom/Extension/modules/Schedulers/Ext/ScheduledTasks/CleanMeetingsScheduler.php`.

This will add a new job to the job strings and a new method that the
scheduler will call:

.Example 13.1: Example Clean Meetings Scheduler
[source,php]
 1 <?php
 2 /*
 3  * We add the method name to the $job_strings array.
 4  * This is the method that jobs for this scheduler will call.
 5  */
 6 $job_strings[] = 'cleanMeetingsScheduler';
 7 
 8 /**
 9  * Example scheduled job to change any 'Planned' meetings older than a month
10  * to 'Not Held'.
11  * @return bool
12  */
13 function cleanMeetingsScheduler(){
14   //Get the cutoff date for which meetings will be considered
15  $cutOff = new DateTime('now - 1 month');
16  $cutOff = $cutOff->format('Y-m-d H:i:s');
17 
18  //Get an instance of the meetings bean for querying
19   //see the Working With Beans chapter.
20   $bean = BeanFactory::getBean('Meetings');
21 
22   //Get the list of meetings older than the cutoff that are marked as Planned
23   $query = "meetings.date_start < '$cutOff' AND meetings.status = 'Planned'";
24   $meetings = $bean->get_full_list('',$query);
25 
26   foreach($meetings as $meeting){
27     //Mark each meeting as Not Held
28     $meeting->status = 'Not Held';
29     //Save the meeting changes
30     $meeting->save();
31   }
32   //Signify we have successfully ran
33   return true;
34 }



We also make sure that we add a language file in `custom/Extension/modules/Schedulers/Ext/Language/en_us.cleanMeetingsScheduler.php`
again, the name of the file doesn’t matter but it is helpful to use
something descriptive. This will define the language string for our job
so the user sees a nice label. See the section on language strings for
more information. The key for the mod strings will be
LBL_UPPERMETHODNAME. In our case our method name is
`cleanMeetingsScheduler` so our language label key will be
`LBL_CLEANMEETINGSSCHEDULER`.

.Example 13.2: Example Language string for Clean Meetings Scheduler
[source,php]
1 <?php
2 //We add the mod string for our method here.
3 $mod_strings['LBL_CLEANMEETINGSSCHEDULER'] = 'Mark old, planned meetings as Not \
4 Held';



If we perform a repair and rebuild our method will now be packaged up
into the scheduler ext file (see the Extensions section for more
information on this process) and will be available in the schedulers
page. Note that for any changes to the scheduler method you will need to
perform another quick repair and rebuild - even in developer mode. We
can now create a new scheduler to call our new method:

image:images/CreateMeetingsScheduler.png[Creating a scheduler that uses
our new method]

This will now behave just like any other scheduler and we can have this
run as often (or as rarely) as we would like. Take care here. The
default frequency is every one minute. If your task is heavy duty or
long running this may not be what you would prefer. Here we settle for
once a day.

== Job Queue

Sometimes you will require code to perform a long running task but you
do not need the user to wait for this to be completed. A good example of
this is sending an email in a logic hook (see the link:../12.-logic-hooks[Logic Hooks] chapter
for information on these). Assuming we have the following logic hook:

.Example 13.3: Example Email sending Logic Hook
[source,php]
 1 class SomeClass
 2 {
 3     function SomeMethod($bean, $event, $arguments)
 4     {
 5 
 6         //Perform some setup of the email class
 7         require_once "include/SugarPHPMailer.php";
 8         $mailer=new SugarPHPMailer();
 9         $admin = new Administration();
10         $admin->retrieveSettings();
11         $mailer->prepForOutbound();
12         $mailer->setMailerForSystem();
13         $admin = new Administration();
14         $admin->retrieveSettings();
15         $admin->settings['notify_fromname']
16         $mailer->From     = $admin->settings['notify_fromaddress']
17         $mailer->FromName = $emailSettings['from_name'];
18         $mailer->IsHTML(true);
19 
20         //Add message and recipient.
21         //We could go all out here and load and populate an email template
22         //or get the email address from the bean
23         $mailer->Subject = 'My Email Notification! '.$bean->name;
24         $mailer->Body = $event. ' fired for bean '.$bean->name;
25         $mailer->AddAddress('Jim@example.com');
26         return $mailer->Send();
27     }
28 }



This will work fine. However you do not want the user to have to wait
for the email to be sent out as this can cause the UI to feel sluggish.
Instead you can create a Job and place it into the job queue and this
will be picked by the scheduler. Let’s look at an example of how you
would do this.

First we want our Logic Hook class to create the scheduled job:

.Example 13.4: Example Scheduled Job Creation
[source,php]
 1 class SomeClass
 2 {
 3     function SomeMethod($bean, $event, $arguments)
 4     {
 5       require_once 'include/SugarQueue/SugarJobQueue.php';
 6       $scheduledJob = new SchedulersJob();
 7 
 8       //Give it a useful name
 9       $scheduledJob->name = "Email job for {$bean->module_name} {$bean->id}";
10 
11       //Jobs need an assigned user in order to run. You can use the id
12       //of the current user if you wish, grab the assigned user from the
13       //current bean or anything you like.
14       //Here we use the default admin user id for simplicity
15       $scheduledJob->assigned_user_id = '1';
16 
17       //Pass the information that our Email job will need
18       $scheduledJob->data = json_encode(array(
19                                             'id' => $bean->id,
20                                             'module' => $bean->module_name)
21                                         );
22 
23       //Tell the scheduler what class to use
24       $scheduledJob->target = "class::BeanEmailJob";
25 
26       $queue = new SugarJobQueue();
27       $queue->submitJob($scheduledJob);
28     }
29 }



Next we create the BeanEmailJob class. This is placed into the `custom/Extensions/modules/Schedulers/Ext/ScheduledTasks/` directory
with the same name as the class. So in our example we will have: +
`custom/Extensions/modules/Schedulers/Ext/ScheduledTasks/BeanEmailJob.php`

.Example 13.5: Example Scheduler job
[source,php]
 1 class BeanEmailJob implements RunnableSchedulerJob
 2 {
 3   public function run($arguments)
 4   {
 5 
 6     //Only different part of the email code.
 7     //We grab the bean using the supplied arguments.
 8     $arguments = json_decode($arguments,1);
 9     $bean = BeanFactory::getBean($arguments['module'],$arguments['id']);
10 
11     //Perform some setup of the email class
12     require_once "include/SugarPHPMailer.php";
13     $mailer=new SugarPHPMailer();
14     $admin = new Administration();
15     $admin->retrieveSettings();
16     $mailer->prepForOutbound();
17     $mailer->setMailerForSystem();
18     $admin = new Administration();
19     $admin->retrieveSettings();
20     $mailer->From     = $admin->settings['notify_fromaddress'];
21     $mailer->FromName = $emailSettings['from_name'];
22     $mailer->IsHTML(true);
23 
24     //Add message and recipient.
25     //We could go all out here and load and populate an email template
26     //or get the email address from the bean
27     $mailer->Subject = 'My Email Notification! '.$bean->name;
28     $mailer->Body = $event. ' fired for bean '.$bean->name;
29     $mailer->AddAddress('Jim@example.com');
30     return $mailer->Send();
31   }
32   public function setJob(SchedulersJob $job)
33   {
34     $this->job = $job;
35   }
36 }



Now whenever a user triggers the hook it will be much quicker since we
are simply persisting a little info to the database. The scheduler will
run this in the background.

=== Retries

Occasionally you may have scheduled jobs which could fail
intermittently. Perhaps you have a job which calls an external API. If
the API is unavailable it would be unfortunate if the job failed and was
never retried. Fortunately the SchedulersJob class has two properties
which govern how retries are handled. These are `requeue` and
`retry_count`.

`requeue`::
  Signifies that this job is eligible for retries.
`retry_count`::
  Signifies how many retries remain for this job. If the job fails this
  value will be decremented.

We can revisit our previous example and add two retries:

.Example 13.6: Setting the retry count on a scheduled job
[source,php]
 6       $scheduledJob = new SchedulersJob();
 7 
 8       //Give it a useful name
 9       $scheduledJob->name = "Email job for {$bean->module_name} {$bean->id}";
10 
11       //Jobs need an assigned user in order to run. You can use the id
12       //of the current user if you wish, grab the assigned user from the
13       //current bean or anything you like.
14       //Here we use the default admin user id for simplicity
15       $scheduledJob->assigned_user_id = '1';
16 
17       //Pass the information that our Email job will need
18       $scheduledJob->data = json_encode(array(
19                                             'id' => $bean->id,
20                                             'module' => $bean->module_name)
21                                         );
22 
23       //Tell the scheduler what class to use
24       $scheduledJob->target = "class::BeanEmailJob";
25 
26       //Mark this job for 2 retries.
27       $scheduledJob->requeue = true;
28       $scheduledJob->retry = 2;



See the section on link:../12.-logic-hooks#logic-hooks-chapter[logic hooks]
for more information on how job failures can be handled.

== Debugging

With Scheduled tasks and jobs running in the background it can sometimes
be difficult to determine what is going on when things go wrong. If you
are debugging a scheduled task the the scheduled task page is a good
place to start. For both scheduled tasks and job queue tasks you can
also check the job_queue table. For example, in MySQL we can check the
last five scheduled jobs:

.Example 13.7: Example MySQL query for listing jobs
[source,php]
SELECT * FROM job_queue ORDER BY date_entered DESC LIMIT 5



This will give us information on the last five jobs. Alternatively we
can check on specific jobs:

.Example 13.8: Example MySQL query for listing BeanEmailJobs
[source,php]
SELECT * FROM job_queue WHERE target = 'class::BeanEmailJob'



In either case this will give details for the job(s):

.Example 13.9: Example MySQL list of jobs
[source,php]
*************************** 1. row ***************************
assigned_user_id: 1
              id: 6cdf13d5-55e9-946e-9c98-55044c5cecee
            name: Email job for Accounts 103c4c9b-336f-0e87-782e-5501defb5900
         deleted: 0
    date_entered: 2015-03-14 14:58:15
   date_modified: 2015-03-14 14:58:25
    scheduler_id:
    execute_time: 2015-03-14 14:58:00
          status: done
      resolution: success
         message: NULL
          target: class::BeanEmailJob
            data: {"id":"103c4c9b-336f-0e87-782e-5501defb5900","module":"Accounts"}
         requeue: 0
     retry_count: NULL
   failure_count: NULL
       job_delay: 0
          client: CRON3b06401793b3975cd00c0447c071ef9a:7781
percent_complete: NULL
1 row in set (0.00 sec)



Here we can check the status, resolution and message fields. If the
status is `queued` then either the scheduler has not yet run or it isn’t
running. Double check your Cron settings if this is the case.

It may be the case that the job has ran but failed for some reason. In
this case you will receive a message telling you to check the logs.
Checking the logs usually provides enough information, particularly if
you have made judicious use of logging (see the chapter on logging) in
your job.

It is possible that the job is failing outright, in which case your
logging may not receive output before the scheduler exits. In this case
you can usually check your PHP logs.

As a last resort you can manually run the scheduler from the SuiteCRM
directory using:

.Example 13.10: Running the scheduler manually
[source,php]
php -f cron.php


Using this in addition to outputting any useful information should track
down even the oddest of bugs. link:../13.-scheduled-tasks[↩]
