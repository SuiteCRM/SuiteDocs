== 1. Example of Field Logic

In this example we are going to see how to add field logic in order to:

- Hide a field depending on another fields value.
- Mark a field as required depending on another field value

**Hide a field**

As an example of how to hide a field. We are going to add configuration to the `priority` field in order to hide it whenever the Case's `State` is set to `Closed`. When the Case is closed the "Priority" field is no longer necessary
and thus we don't need it to display. As a result we will see something like the screenshot below shows.

**Make a field required**

On the other hand, it would be great if when the Case's `Status` is set to `Open_Assigned`, the `Priority` field could be marked as a required field, as shown on the following screenshot.

For this we will add a second entry to the `logic` configuration. as you can see on the code snippet below.

== 2. How does this look as Code?

The following code block shows an example of the configuration we need to add to the vardefs in order to get the logic described on the previous section

<?php

...

        'priority' => array(
            'name' => 'priority',
            'vname' => 'LBL_PRIORITY',
            'type' => 'enum',
            'options' => 'case_priority_dom',
            'len' => 100,
            'audited' => true,
            'comment' => 'The priority of the case',
            'logic' => [
                'display' => [
                    'key' => 'displayType',
                    'modes' => ['detail', 'edit', 'create'],
                    'params' => [
                        'fieldDependencies' => [
                            'state',
                        ],
                        'targetDisplayType' => 'none',
                        'activeOnFields' =>  [
                            'state' => [ 'Closed']
                        ]
                    ]
                ],
                'required' => [
                    'key' => 'required',
                    'modes' => ['edit', 'create'],
                    'params' => [
                        'fieldDependencies' => [
                            'status',
                        ],
                        'activeOnFields' =>  [
                            'status' => [ 'Open_Assigned']
                        ]
                    ]
                ]
            ]
        ),

== 3. The configurations explained

There are two different types of logic used in the example above, `DisplayType` and `Required`. Which we are going to cover next.

=== DisplayType

[source, php]
----
<?php

...

                'display' => [
                    'key' => 'displayType',
                    'modes' => ['detail', 'edit', 'create'],
                    'params' => [
                        'fieldDependencies' => [
                            'state',
                        ],
                        'targetDisplayType' => 'none',
                        'activeOnFields' =>  [
                            'state' => [ 'Closed']
                        ]
                    ]
                ],

        ...
----

==== Properties description

* Key
- The `key` within the named `display` array is stating which logic type will be used for the following.
In this case it's `displayType`.

* Modes
- Modes is what views you would like your logic to take affect on, as shown above it will be `detail`, `edit` and `create`.
Another example of a `mode` that could be selected could be `list` for example.

* Params
** Each type of field logic will accept different params.
** `DisplayType` logic accepts the following:
*** `fieldDependencies` is where you declare the field(s) that you would like your logic to depend on
*** `activeOnFields` is where you declare the field/values that trigger the change of the field to a required field

=== Required

[source, php]
----
<?php

...

                'required' => [
                    'key' => 'required',
                    'modes' => ['edit', 'create'],
                    'params' => [
                        'fieldDependencies' => [
                            'status',
                        ],
                        'activeOnFields' =>  [
                            'status' => [ 'Open_Assigned']
                        ]
                    ]

        ...
----

==== Properties description

* Key
- The `key` within the named `required` array is stating which logic type will be used for the following.
In this case it's `required`.

* Modes
- Modes is what views you would like your logic to take affect on, as shown above it will be `detail`, `edit` and `create`.
Another example of a `mode` that could be selected could be list for example.

* Params
** Each type of field logic will accept different params.
** `required` logic accepts the following:
*** `fieldDependencies` is where you declare the field(s) that you would like your logic to depend on
*** `activeOnFields` is where you declare the field/values that trigger the change of the field to a required field

== Customising this functionality

If you would like to add this functionality into your CRM code or add this and change it to fit your requiremnts then
please add it to `<suite8path>/public/legacy/custom/Extension/modules/<module>/Ext/Vardefs/<any-filename>.php`.
