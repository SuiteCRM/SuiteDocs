When making these changes be sure to make them in the custom directory, ie: 'public/legacy/custom/modules/<module>/...'

== 1. Introduction

Display logic allows you to define rules to hide and show fields depending on other fields values.

=== 1.1 Example scenario

As an example of how to hide a field, we are going to add configurations to the `phone_office` field on the Accounts Module.
The configuration we add will set the field to hide when the Account Name is `Example`.

== 2.Logic Metadata definition

The first thing to define is the `displayLogic` entry in the metadata. This is where we are going to define the triggers to hide/show our field.

The configuration for the logic can be added to the `vardefs.php` or the `detailviewdefs.php`.

In the following example we are going to add them to the `Accounts` module field vardefs.

=== 2.1 Steps to add the logic on the custom vardefs

. Create a new field in custom extensions for Accounts module:
.. Example:  `public/legacy/custom/Extension/modules/Accounts/Ext/Vardefs/annual_revenue.php`
. Copy the 'phone_office' definition from `public/legacy/include/SugarObjects/templates/company/vardefs.php`
. Replace the `logic` entry to the  `phone_office` definition with the code on the snippet below.
** Re-set permissions if needed (will depend on your setup)
. Run `Repair and Rebuild` on Admin menu


[source,php]
----
<?php

$dictionary['Account']['fields']['phone_office'] = array(
    'name' => 'phone_office',
    'vname' => 'LBL_PHONE_OFFICE',
    'type' => 'phone',
    'dbType' => 'varchar',
    'len' => 100,
    'audited' => true,
    'unified_search' => true,
    'full_text_search' => array('boost' => 1),
    'comment' => 'The office phone number',
    'merge_filter' => 'enabled',
    'displayLogic' => [
        'hide_on_name' => [
            'key' => 'displayType',
            'modes' => [
                'detail',
                'edit',
                'create',
            ],
            'params' => [
                'fieldDependencies' => [
                    'name',
                ],
                'targetDisplayType' => 'none',
                'activeOnFields' => [
                    'name' => ['Example'],
                ]
            ]
        ]
    ]
);
----

=== 3. Display Logic

Within `displayLogic` for specific fields you can set multiple definitions. Each definition will work like an `OR`.
For example:

[source,php]
----
    'hide_on_name' => [
        'key' => 'displayType',
        'modes' => ['detail', 'edit', 'create'],
        'params' => [
            'fieldDependencies' => [
                'name',
            ],
            'targetDisplayType' => 'none',
            'activeOnFields' => [
                'name' => ['Example']
            ]
        ]
    ],
    // OR
    'hide_on_website' => [
        'key' => 'displayType',
        'modes' => ['detail', 'edit', 'create'],
        'params' => [
            'fieldDependencies' => [
                'website',
            ],
            'targetDisplayType' => 'none',
            'activeOnFields' => [
                'website' => [ ['operator' => 'is-empty' ] ]
            ]
        ]
    ],
----

This means that if `Name` is `Example` the field will hide or if `Website` is empty then the field will also hide.

=== 4. Properties description

* Key
- The `key` within the named `hide_on_name` array is stating which logic type will be used for the following.
In this case it's `displayType`.

* Modes
- Modes are views you would like your `displayLogic` to take effect on, as shown above it will be `detail`, `edit` and `create`.
Another example of a `mode` that could be selected could be `list` for example.

==== Params

===== Field Dependencies
`fieldDependencies` is where you declare the field(s) that you would like your logic to depend on.

[source,php]
----
'fieldDependencies' => [
    'name',
    'website'
]
----

==== Active on Fields

`activeOnFields` is where you declare the field/values that trigger the change of the field to a shown/hidden field.

In the example above we have the field `phone_office` hide when name is `Example`.

If we wanted it to hide if it was either `Example` or another value such as `User` then a new value would be added like so:

[source,php]
----
'activeOnFields' => [
  'name' => ['Example', 'User'],
],
----

image:Hidden-Phone-Field-User.png[Hidden Phone Field]

===== Multiple Fields

Within the `activeOnFields` you can add more than one field such as:

[source,php]
----
'activeOnFields' => [
  'name' => ['Example'],
  'website' => ['www.google.com', 'www.yahoo.com' ]
],
----

This works like an AND. If Name is `Example` AND Website is either `www.google.com` or `www.yahoo.com`.

image:Shown-Phone-Field-Example.png[Name Example Shown]

image:Hidden-Phone-Field-N-W.png[Name and Website Example]

When adding more fields to `activeOnFields` be sure to also add them to `fieldDependencies`

===== With operators

When using operators on `activeonFields` you can use the operator once, or multiple times within the same field to meet specific criteria.

[source,php]
----
'activeOnFields' => [
    'website' => [ ['operator' => 'is-empty'] ]
]
----

====== Multiple Operators

[source,php]
----
'activeOnFields' => [
    'employees' => [
    //AND
    [
        'operator' => 'greater-than',
        'value' => 5
    ],
    [
        'operator' => 'less-than',
        'value' => 25
    ],
    [
        'operator' => 'not-equal',
        //OR
        'values' => [15, 20]
    ],
    ['operator' => 'not-empty'],
]
----

In the example above if `employees` is:

* Greater than 5
* Less than 25
* Not equal to 15 or 20
* Has a value

Then the field will hide from the view.

An example using the code above on the Accounts `Industry` Field:

image:Shown-Field-Industry-Employees.png[Industry Example Shown]

image:Hidden-Field-Industry-Employees.png[Industry Example Hidden]

====== Using Fields as Comparison

When using operators you can use another field for the comparison. For example (within Opportunities):

[source,php]
----
'activeOnFields' => [
    'amount' => [ ['operator' => 'less-than', 'field' => 'probability'] ]
]
----

If `amount` is less than `probability` then the chosen field will hide from display.

You can find more information on the different operators link:../../operators/[here.]

==== Target Display Type

`targetDisplayType` will either be `none` or `show`.

`None` will hide the field if conditions are met and `Show` will display the field.
