= Record Management

We have covered the several views that you are presented with so we will
now move onto record management. In this section we will cover all areas
of record management so that you can efficiently store and manage
customer data.

== Creating Records

You can create records within modules from various different areas of
your Interface. Detailed below are screen shots of record creation
points.

image:43Create_record1.png[title="Create Record method 1"]

image:44Create_record2.png[title="Create Record method 2"]

image:45Create_record_3.png[title="Create Record method 3"]

Once you click the create button, you will be taken to the creation
screen. This is essentially the link:../views/[Edit View] that we have covered
previously. This allows you to fill in the appropriate data for that record. Fields with
the red star `*` are required fields. Validation is performed so that a
record cannot be saved within the CRM unless data is valid for required
fields.

image:46Create_contact.png[title="Record creation"]

Once you have populated all data for the record, you can save the record
which will create the record within the module in the CRM. Once saved,
you will be redirected to the Detail View of the record you have
created.

== Editing Records

You can edit records within modules from various different areas of your
Interface. Detailed below are screen shots of record editing points.

image:47Edit_contact.png[title="Edit Record method 1"]

image:48Edit_contact.png[title="Edir Record method 2"]

Once you click the *edit* button(or pencil), you will be taken to the Edit
View. This allows you to edit/populate the appropriate data for that
record. Fields with the red star(*) are required fields. Validation is
performed so that a record cannot be saved within the CRM unless data is
valid for required fields.

Once you have edited/populated the record data, you can save the record
which will update the existing record with the new data populated when
editing. Once saved, you will be redirected to the Detail View of the
record you have edited.

== Deleting Records

You can delete records within modules from both the List View and Detail
View. Detailed below are screen shots of record editing points:

=== Detail View Deletion method

Deleting records from the Detail View is a simple process. You simply
have to click the *'Delete'* button.

image:49Delete_contact.png[title="Delete Records"]

When you click the delete button on a record, you will receive a popup
which will ask you to confirm that you want to delete the record.

image:50Delete_contact.png[title="Confirm deletion"]

You can either click *Cancel* or *OK*. Clicking Cancel will revert you back
to the Detail View of the record and will not delete it. Clicking OK
will action the record deletion. If you choose to delete the record, the
record will be deleted and you will be redirected to the module List
View.

=== List View Deletion method

To delete records from the List View, you can select records using the
checkbox option on the left hand side of the view. It is possible to
select single records or use the 'Select this Page' or 'Select All'
options, to select all records from the page or all records within the
module.

image:51ListView_deletion.png[title="List View deletion method"]

Once the records are selected to delete, you can click the *'Delete'*
button. When you click the delete button on a record, you will receive a
popup which will display the number of records being deleted and ask you
to confirm that you want to delete the record.

You can either click *Cancel* or *OK*. Clicking Cancel will revert you back
to the Detail View of the record and will not delete it. Clicking OK
will action the record deletion. If you choose to delete the record, the
record will be deleted and you will be redirected to the module List
View.

== Mass Updating Records

You can mass update records from the List View of any module, given this
option is made available to you. To mass update records, you have to
check the records in the List View and then select the 'Mass Update'
option from the dropdown menu (next to the delete link).

image:52Mass_update_records.png[title="Mass Updating Records"]

Clicking the mass update option will display a screen at the bottom of
the List View. This will list all fields that can be mass updated by
you.

image:53Mass_update.png[title="Mass update"]

Once you have populated the fields you wish to mass update, you can
either click btn:[Update] or btn:[Cancel]. Cancelling the mass update will
cancel any changes and redirect you to the List View of the module.
Clicking update will update all selected records with the changes
specified.

image:54Mass_update.png[title="Mass update"]

== Merging Records

You can merge records from the List View of any module, given this
option is made available to you, or via the Detail View if you follow
the 'Find Duplicates' process.

To merge records, you have to check the records in the List View and
then select the *'Merge'* option from the dropdown menu (next to the
delete link).

image:55Merge.png[title="Merge"]

Once you have clicked on the *'Merge'* option, you will be presented with
a merge screen. This will show the primary record and the duplicates
that you wish to merge with that primary record.

image:182Merging_records.png["Merge screen"]

You can select which record is primary using the *'Set as primary'* button
on the right of the merge view. You can move data from the duplicate
records to the primary record using the btn:[<<] buttons. In this example,
we have moved the First Name and Last Name from the duplicate record to
the primary record.

image:183Merging_records.png[title="Merge fields"]

Once you have made the required changes on the merge screen, you can
click btn:[Save Merge] or btn:[Cancel]. Clicking cancel will discard the merge
changes and will revert you to the List View for that module. Clicking
'Save Merge' will continue the Merge process and will prompt you to
inform you that the duplicate record will be deleted.

image:184Save_merge.png[title="Confirm merge"]

You can click *'OK'* or *'Cancel'*. Clicking Cancel will discard the merge
changes and will revert you to the List View for that module. Clicking
'OK' will save the merge and will redirect you to the Detail View for
the merged record.

image:185Saved_merge.png[title="Finished merge"]

As can be seen from the example, the merge has completed successfully.
The First Name and Last Name have been updated, and all other data has
been retained.

== Importing Records

It is possible to import data easily by using SuiteCRM's easy-to-use
User Import Wizard. There are many hints and tips as you progress
through the Import Wizard on the requirements of importing data and for
further steps in the Wizard.

=== User Import Wizard features

There are many features of the Import Wizard which make it easier for
you to map data to CRM fields and also for future imports. These are:

* *Sample .csv file for easier import of data* — Use the available sample
.csv file as a template for import of files
* *Retain settings from previous imports* — Save/preserve import file
properties, mappings, and duplicate check indexes from previous imports
for ease of current data import process
* *Ability to accept both database name and display labels of drop-down
and multi-select field items* — Field labels as well as database names
are accepted and mapped during import, but only the field labels are
displayed for ease of use
* *Ability to accept both usernames and full names in user fields during
import and export of data* — Full names of Users displayed for Assigned
To and other User-related fields in exported .csv file for easier
identification of user records
* *Ability to auto-detect file properties in import file* — Upload import
files without specifying file properties such as tab, comma, double and
single quotes, date and time formats, making the process simpler and
faster
* *Ability to import contacts from external sources such as Google* —
Ability to import Google Contacts for person-type modules such as
Contacts, Leads, and Targets, relate SuiteCRM records to Google
Contacts, and communicate with Google Contacts from within SuiteCRM

=== Steps to Import data

== Exporting Records

You can export SuiteCRM records in .csv format. When you exports records
from the CRM, you will be provided with the .csv file to download when
the export has finished executing. You can save and open this file in
applications such as Libre Office Calc or Microsoft Office Excel.

The .csv file displays in a tabular format with columns and rows. When
data is exported from the CRM, the record ID is included with all other
fields that are specified in the export list for that module. You can
then use the record ID as a reference for performing a 'Create new
records and update existing records' import, as detailed in the
<<Importing Records>> section of the user guide.

{{% notice note %}}
When exporting values from drop-down lists, SuiteCRM exports the
ID associated with each option and not the display labels. For example,
if a drop down list has options labelled High, Medium and Low with an ID
of 1, 2 and 3 – the .csv file will show the drop down options as 1, 2 or
3.
{{% /notice %}}

.  Select Open to open the export file in .csv format or select Save to
Disk to save the .csv file to your local machine.
.  Click OK to execute the operation. If you chose to open the file,
the csv file opens in Microsoft Excel.
