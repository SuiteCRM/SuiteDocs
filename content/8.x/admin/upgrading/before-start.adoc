== 1. Initial recommendations

*1.1.* Before running the upgrade, please make sure your system **complies with the new version compatibility matrix**.
Check the link:../../compatibility-matrix[*Compatibility Matrix*] for complete information on compatible versions.

*1.2.* It is recommended that you run the **upgrade process in a development instance and test**. Only after testing, deploy the upgraded version on to a production instance

*1.3.* Before upgrading please make sure to create a **backup** of your instance code and database.

*1.4.* By default, the upgrade commands will set the `error_reporting` to a less strict mode to suppress warnings.
** The error_reporting value set is `E_ALL & ~E_DEPRECATED & ~E_STRICT & ~E_NOTICE & ~E_WARNING`
** If you want to apply a stricter mode you can specify the `-vvv` on each of the commands. This will set `E_ALL` on `error_reporting`

*1.5* Please note that the upgrade process may **remove any non core file/directories** you have on your project under the `root` folder or the `public/legacy/` folder

*1.6* Before running any of the commands described next, please make sure your SuiteCRM 8 instance `APP_ENV` is set to `APP_ENV=prod` mode (check `.env` and '.env.local' files)
