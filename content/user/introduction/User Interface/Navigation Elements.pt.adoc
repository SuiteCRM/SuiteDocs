= Navigation Elements

The ability to easily view and navigate to areas of the CRM is key to
improved productivity and user adoption. SuiteCRM has a clear UI which
has various elements we will cover in this section.

== Top navigation menu

The top navigation menu is the main menu users will use to navigate to
modules to create and manage records. The standard layout for the top
navigation is a list of 10 modules. The ordering for this menu is
determined by the order of the modules in Admin → Display Modules and
Subpanels. The top navigation menu has six elements. These are:

* *CRM Name* – This is the name for the CRM which is specified on
installation. This defaults to SuiteCRM.
* *Module Menu* – This lists or groups the modules, dependent on the user
preference. This provides the ability for users to navigate to modules
within the CRM.
* *Desktop Notification Count* – This shows the number of desktop
notifications the user has not yet read. These can be managed by the
user. For full details on Desktop Notifications, see the
link:../desktop-notifications/[Desktop Notifications] section within this
user guide.
* *Quick Create* – Quick create allows the quick creation of key module
records globally within the CRM.
* *Global/Full Text Search* – Allows users to search the CRM globally for
records/data.
* *User menu* – This displays the user name for the user currently logged
in. There is a drop down menu which gives users access to Employees,
their profile, the about page and a link to logout.

To view a module, you can click on the module name. This will take you
to the List View of that module. For full details on views, read the
link:../views/[Views] section of this user guide.

Hovering over a module name will produce a drop down menu. This drop
down menu displays the Actions and Recently Viewed records for that
module.

You can edit records displayed in the Recently Viewed section of the
drop down menu by clicking the pencil icon. This will direct you to the
Edit View for that record.

There is also a grouped tab navigation structure for SuiteCRM. Users can
set this option in their user preferences. For full details on modifying
user preferences, see the link:/user/introduction/managing-user-accounts[Managing User Accounts]
section of this user guide.

The grouped tab navigation menu gives the user the ability to group
modules within a tab such as the Sales Tab.

== Quick Create

You can click the 'create' icon in the top navigation menu to access the
Quick Create options. This is a list of commonly used modules with the
ability to create new records within these modules from any location.

== Sidebar

The sidebar is part of the responsive theme and is a user configurable
option. The sidebar can be expanded and collapsed by clicking on the
button highlighted below.

=== Actions

This displays the Actions for the module you are currently viewing. For
example, if you are viewing the Accounts module, the actions that
display are: Create Account, View Accounts, Import Accounts. This
provides you with one-click access to module actions.

=== Recently Viewed

This section displays the last 10 records you have viewed. This leaves a
breadcrumbs trail so that previously viewed records can be quickly and
easily accessed via the sidebar. There is also the option to click the
pencil icon, which will take you directly to the Edit View of the
record.
