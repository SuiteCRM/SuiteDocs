= 7. Controllers

SuiteCRM follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern and as such has
the concept of controllers. The controller is responsible for making
changes to the Model as well as passing control to the view as
appropriate. SuiteCRM has the concept of actions which are actions that
will be taken by the controller. Let’s take a look at a SuiteCRM URL:

.Example 7.1: Example SuiteCRM URL
[source,php]
example.com/index.php?module=Accounts&action=index



In this (rather boring) example we see that the module is Accounts. This
will determine which controller to use and then call the index action on
that controller.

SuiteCRM will first look for the controller in
`custom/module/<TheModule>/controller.php`. If this is not found then
next `module/<TheModule>/controller.php` will be checked. Finally if
neither of these controllers exist then the default controller will be
used. The default controller can be found in
`include/MVC/Controller/SugarController.php`.

== Customising controllers

Ordinarily the default controller handles the request and delegates to
the appropriate views etc. However custom controllers can be used to add
or alter functionality. Let’s look at adding a new action.

In the first instance we will have to add our custom controller. This
will vary slightly depending on the nature of the module.

=== Custom module

In this case we can place the file directly into our module. You should
create a new file (if it doesn’t exist) at
`modules/<TheModule>/controller.php`. The contents will look similar to:

.Example 7.2: Creating a custom controller for a custom module
[source,php]
1 <?php
2 if(!defined('sugarEntry') || !sugarEntry) die('Not A Valid Entry Point');
3 class <TheModule>Controller extends SugarController
4 {
5 
6 }



=== Pre-existing modules

For pre-existing modules you should add the controller to +
`custom/modules/<TheModule>/controller.php`.

The contents of this file will vary depending on whether you wish to
extend the existing controller (if it exists) or create your own version
completely. It is usually best to extend the existing controller since
this will retain important logic. You should note the naming convention
here. We name the class +
`Custom<TheModule>Controller`.

Here we don’t extend the existing controller or no such controller
exists:

.Example 7.3: Creating a custom controller for an existing module
[source,php]
1 <?php
2 if(!defined('sugarEntry') || !sugarEntry) die('Not A Valid Entry Point');
3 class Custom<TheModule>Controller extends SugarController
4 {
5 
6 }



Alternatively we extend the existing controller. Note that we are
requiring the existing controller:

.Example 7.4: Creating a custom controller for an existing module with an existing controller
[source,php]
1 <?php
2 if(!defined('sugarEntry') || !sugarEntry) die('Not A Valid Entry Point');
3 
4 require_once 'modules/<TheModule>/controller.php';
5 
6 class Custom<TheModule>Controller extends <TheModule>Controller
7 {
8 
9 }



=== Adding the action

Now we can add a new action to our controller. Actions are created as
methods on the controller with the name `action_<actionName>`. For
example, to create a new action called ‘echo’ we could create the
following method in one of the controllers we have created above. This
can then perform whatever logic that is needed. In our example we will
log the REQUEST and simply redirect:

.Example 7.5: Adding a custom controller action method
[source,php]
1 public function action_echo(){
2   $GLOBALS['log']->debug("Echo called with request: ".print_r($_REQUEST,1));
3   SugarApplication::redirect('index.php');
4 }



=== Legacy Style

In previous versions of SugarCRM a new action was added by creating a
file in either `modules/<TheModule>/<actionname>.php` or
`custom/modules/<TheModule>/<actionname>.php`. Although this still works
it is not recommended. link:../7.-controllers[↩]
