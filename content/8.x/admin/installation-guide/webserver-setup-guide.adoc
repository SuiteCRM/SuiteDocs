When installing SuiteCRM from pre-build installable package zip you **do not** need to install the dependencies that are for development, namely: node, angular cli, yarn/npm.

The SuiteCRM 8 pre-built installable package zip comes with the pre-built front end files under `public/dist` and all the required libs on vendors.

Please check the `Helpfull Resources` section from link:#_2_install_required_software[Install required software] for instructions on how to install php modules

== 4. Configuring URL re-writes

In order for api routes to work you need allow url re-writes.

* All SuiteCRM-Core api calls depend on this (calls to `api/graphql`) if re-rewrites are not allowed you will get a `404` when calling the api.

In `apache` webserver this can be achieved by enabling mod-rewrite and configuring the vhost.

{{% notice note %}}
It is highly recommended that you update the webroot or configure vhost to point to the `public` folder inside SuiteCRM folder. If the webroot is pointing to SuiteCRM folder instead of the public folder, all the files under SuiteCRM folder maybe be exposed to the web.

Update your vhost configuration to add the following:

[source,xml]
----
<VirtualHost *:80>

    DocumentRoot /<path-to-suite>/public
    <Directory /<path-to-suite>/public>
        AllowOverride All
        Order Allow,Deny
        Allow from All
    </Directory>

</VirtualHost>

== 5. Configure php error_reporting

Please make sure that notices aren't considered on `error_handling`. For that you can update the error handling entry in `php.ini`

[source,ini]
----
error_reporting = E_ALL & ~E_DEPRECATED & ~E_STRICT & ~E_NOTICE & ~E_WARNING
