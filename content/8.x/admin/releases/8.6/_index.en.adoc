==== icon:star[] Enhancements

===== Pre-Install Check Page

A Pre-Install Check Page has been added. This page will show any system requirements that aren't met before you proceed to the install process. More information can be found on the link:../../installation-guide/running-the-ui-installer[Install via UI documentation]

===== Usability improvements

====== 1. Quick Save / Search

* *On ListView Filter Panel:*
** Hitting `Enter` will apply the currently defined criteria and the search.
** When saving a filter, hitting `Enter` will save the filter and search.
* **On Record View: ** When creating/ editing records, hitting `ctrl`+`Enter` calls the record save.

====== 2. Date fields will now show the pop-up calendar when click on the input like they do when the calendar icon is clicked.

====== 3. Listview Column Resizing

* In order to show more rows on the screen, the ListView column padding has been reduced and the column width has been set to dynamically adjust.

====== 4. Enum component is now using regular dropdowns instead of the chips component

====== 5. Relate field component has been re-implemented

====== 6. MultiSelect field component has been re-implemented

====== 7. Recently Viewed added to navbar

image:Recently-Viewed.gif[Recently Viewed]

====== 8. Back to ListView button added to Record View

* To make navigation easier SuiteCRM now includes a back to list view button. It redirects back to the module list view on the page the user was before.
