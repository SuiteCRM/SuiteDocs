==== icon:star[] Enhancements

==== SuiteCRM 7.12.x to SuiteCRM 8 Migration

* A migration path from version 7.12+ to 8.x has been added. Please see the following documentation page for instructions on how to upgrade link:../../../../8.x/admin/installation-guide/legacy-migration[here.]

==== LDAP and SAML Authentication
Authentication with LDAP and SAML (including SAML's user auto creation) has been added, to make it easier to access SuiteCRM by using the same credentials that you may use to access other applications.

To see how to setup and configure the authentication methods, please see the following documentation:

** link:../../../../8.x/admin/configuration/ldap-configuration/[LDAP Setup and Configuration]
** link:../../../../8.x/admin/configuration/saml-configuration/[SAML Setup and Configuration]

==== Duplicate View
When duplicating a record, you will now see the ‘Create’ page for that module:

==== Bulk Select Subpanel
When viewing a subpanel, the Link option has replaced the Select option from the actions drop down. Similar to the Select option, this option will display a pop-up window where one or more records can be selected, to associate with the parent record.

==== History Timeline

==== icon:bug[] Bug Fixes

==== Graphql API
Previously when navigating to ‘http://myhost/index.php#/accounts’ or ‘http://myhost/#/accounts’, the API calls always pointed to ‘http://myhost/api/graphql’ incorrectly.
We have therefore updated this to ensure the Graphql calls point to the correct location pathname instead.

==== System Name
After changing the `System Name` setting in the System Settings, you will now see this change in the browser.

==== Top Widget Changes
Previously when viewing the top widgets, if there is no information the ‘-’ character would be displayed. This has now been changed to make it clear there is no information to display.

==== History and Activity Subpanel Icons
Icons have been added to both the History and Activity subpanels to show which module a record is associated.

==== Github PR's
* PR: https://github.com/salesagility/SuiteCRM-Core/pull/160[160] - Fix https://github.com/salesagility/SuiteCRM-Core/issues/61[#61] and https://github.com/salesagility/SuiteCRM-Core/issues/81[#81] - Allow user to see dates in their time and format
