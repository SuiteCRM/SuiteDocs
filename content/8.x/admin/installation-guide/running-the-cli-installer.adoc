The following sub-sections provide a brief explanation of each parameter you can set

==== 2.1.1 site_url

In the above parameter you should set the url where your SuiteCRM instance is located. A few example:

* `https://example-domain.com`
* `https://localhost`
* `https://crm.example-domain.com`

**Tip: ** you can simply copy the url from you browser's address bar

==== 2.1.2 db_user

In the above parameter you should set the user name for accessing your database.

==== 2.1.3 db_password

In the above parameter you should set the password for accessing your database.

==== 2.1.4 db_host

In the above parameter you should set the host of your database.

{{% notice note %}}
in some systems when using `localhost` doctrine will try to use socket connection. However, socket connection is not supported at the moment, so in such cases, its maybe best to try with the ip, e.g. `127.0.0.1`

==== 2.1.5 db_name

In the above parameter you should set the name you want for the databases that will be created on your host during the install process, e.g. `suite` or `suitecrm` or another valid db name.

==== 2.1.6 db_port

In the above parameter is set to the default port user in `mysql` and `mariadb` database engines. You should only change it in case your database host is using a different port.

==== 2.1.7 demo_data

In the above parameter you can set if, during the install process, you want to pre-populate your database with demo data.

Possible values: 'yes' , 'no'.

==== 2.1.8 admin_username

In the above parameter you can set the username for your SuiteCRM instance's administrator user, e.g. `admin` or any other username you want to give.

==== 2.1.9 admin_password

In the above parameter you can set the password for your SuiteCRM instance's administrator user.

==== 2.1.10 sys_check_option

Ignoring install warnings

Before running the install process, SuiteCRM is going to check for some system requirements, like `max upload file size` or `memory limit`. Some of these checks are optional, meaning that you can install the system without those.
In case you want to proceed with the installation even if there are warnings you can check the `Ignore System Check Warnings` checkbox

Possible values: 'true' (for ignoring) , 'false' (for *not* ignoring).

=== 2.2 Re-set permissions

After allowing time for the installation to complete, again set permissions.

If you are using the terminal you can do this by running:

[source,bash]
----
find . -type d -not -perm 2755 -exec chmod 2755 {} \;
find . -type f -not -perm 0644 -exec chmod 0644 {} \;
find . ! -user www-data -exec chown www-data:www-data {} \;
chmod +x bin/console
----

Please have in mind that:

* The user and group name (in the above example `www-data`) needs to be replaced by the actual system user and group that your webserver runs under. This varies depending on your
operating system. Common web server users are as follows:
** `www-data` (Ubuntu Linux/Apache)
** `apache` (Linux/Apache)

* If the group name differs from the username apache is running with, you may need `0664` instead of `0644`, and `2775` instead of `2755`

=== 2.3 Double-checking configurations

Please double-check that the following configurations are correct

*1* - Legacy config in `public/legacy/config`

* `site_url`:
** if you *do not* have your vhost pointing to the `public` dir within your SuiteCRM 8 root folder, you should append `/public` to your current host
*** e.g. if your address is something like `https://your-host/crm/public`,

*2* - `.htaccess` in `public/legacy/.htaccess

* `RewriteBase`
** If you have your vhost pointing to `legacy` dir within the SuiteCRM 8 root folder. Then the correct value is `RewriteBase /legacy`
** Otherwise, you should prepend the path until the `public` folder.
*** e.g. if your address is something like `https://your-host/crm/public`, then the correct value is `RewriteBase /crm/public/legacy`


=== 2.4  Access the app

You should now be able to access the instance at the `https://<your-suite-crm-instance-path>`
