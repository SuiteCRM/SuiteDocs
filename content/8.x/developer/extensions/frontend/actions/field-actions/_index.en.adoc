== 1. Introduction

Field actions allow you to add custom action buttons next to fields in SugarCRM.

These buttons can trigger specific actions when clicked.

This guide will walk you through the process of adding custom field actions.

=== 1.1 Example scenario

As an example, we will add a custom "Clear" and "Copy" action buttons next to the Website, Office Phone, Fax fields in the Accounts module.

Clicking "Copy" button will copy the value of the field.

Clicking "Clear" button will clear the value of the field.

== 2.Logic Metadata definition


The first thing to define is the `fieldActions` entry in the metadata. This is where the action buttons for fields are defined.

The configuration for the actions can be added only to `detailviewdefs.php`.

In the following example we are going to add them to the `Accounts` module `detailviewdefs.php`.


=== 2.1 Steps to add the actions on the custom detailviewdefs.php

. Copy the core Accounts `detailviewdefs.php` to the custom folder:
.. From: `public/legacy/modules/Accounts/metadata/detailviewdefs.php`
.. To: `public/legacy/custom/modules/Accounts/metadata/detailviewdefs.php`
. Add a new entry for your custom action button on the custom `detailviewdefs.php` with the code on the snippet below
** Re-set permissions if needed (will depend on your setup)
. Run `Repair and Rebuild` on Admin menu
