== 1. Introduction

The `displayTypeBackend` field logic allows to have the show/hide logic done on the backend.

When the conditions for the dependencies on other fields are met, a request is sent to the backend. The value resulting from that backend call is going to be user to hide / show the field.

This allows for more complex calculations. Like calculations where you need values from multiple modules or from external sources.

This guide describes the steps to setup a backend calculation to show/hide a field.

=== 1.1 Example scenario

As an example this guide is going to use the following scenario.

On the `Cases` module we want to show/hide the `priority` field based on the values from the `type` and the `subject` (name) fields.

The rules for showing/hiding are the `priority` are the following:

. Show priority on Error
** When the `type` field has the value `User`
** and the `name` field contains `Error`. (the `Subject` is the same as `name`)
** Show `priority`

. Show priority on Warning
** When the `type` field has the value `User`
** and the `name` field contains `Warning`. (the `Subject` is the same as `name`)
** Show `priority`

. Hide priority otherwise:
.. When the `type` field has the value `User`
.. and the `name` field does not contain `Warning` nor `Error`. (the `Subject` is the same as `name`)
.. Hide `priority`

The following gif shows an example of what we want:

== 2. Logic Metadata definition

{{% notice note %}}
When making these changes be sure to make them in the custom directory, e.g.: 'public/legacy/custom/modules/<module>/...'
{{% /notice %}}

The first thing to define is the `logic` entry in the metadata. This is where we are going to define the triggers for our backend calculation.

The configuration for the logic can be added to the `vardefs.php` or the `detailviewdefs.php`.

In the following example we are going to add them to the `Cases` module `detailviewdefs.php`.


=== 2.1 Steps to add the logic on the custom detailviewdefs.php

. Copy the core Cases `detailviewdefs.php` to the custom folder:
.. From: `public/legacy/modules/Cases/metadata/detailviewdefs.php`
.. To: `public/legacy/custom/modules/Cases/metadata/detailviewdefs.php`
. Replace the `priority` entry on the custom `detailviewdefs.php` with the code on the snippet on link:./#_2_2_logic_definition[2.2 Logic definition] section
. Re-set permissions (may not be needed, this will depend on your configuration)
. Run `Repair and Rebuild` on Admin menu
. (optional) If you have some kind of php cache like opcache or APCu, you will need to re-start apache.

=== 2.2 Logic definition

The following were the changes applied in order to have the logic triggering when we want.

One thing to note on the following definition is that the field is configured to be hidden by default, which is archived by setting the `'display' => 'none'`.

From:
[source,php]

    array(
      0 =>
      array(
        'name' => 'case_number',
        'label' => 'LBL_CASE_NUMBER',
      ),
      1 => 'priority',
    ),

          0 =>
          array(
            'name' => 'case_number',
            'label' => 'LBL_CASE_NUMBER',

                        'fieldDependencies' => [
                            'type',
                            'name',
                        ],

                        'activeOnFields' => [
                            'type' => ['User'],
                            'name' => [
                                ['operator' => 'not-empty' ]
                            ]
                        ]
                    ]
                ],
          ],
        ),

==== 2.2.1 Logic Properties description

* Key
. The `key` within the named `logic` array is stating which logic type will be used. To use backend logic calculations we need to set `displayTypeBackend`.

* Modes
- Modes are view modes we want our `displayTypeBackend` logic to take effect on, in this example we want on `detail`, `edit` and `create`.
Another example of a `mode` that could be selected could be `list` for example.

===== Params

====== Field Dependencies

`fieldDependencies` is where we declare the field(s) that we want our logic to depend on.

In this example we depend on `type` and `name` as they are the two fields that the scenario rules depend on

[source,php]
----

...
'fieldDependencies' => [
    'type',
    'name',
]

...

----

===== Active on Fields

`activeOnFields` is where you declare the field/value conditions that trigger the logic to run. In this case call to the backend to determine whether to show or hide the field.

As stated on the scenario conditions we want:

. When the `type` field has value `User`

So we are going to set the logic to only trigger when the `type` field has value `User`

For the `name` field we have multiple value dependencies described on the scenario conditions:

. the `name` field contains `Error`. (the `Subject` is the same as `name`)
. the `name` field contains `Warning`. (the `Subject` is the same as `name`)
. the `name` field does not contain `Warning` nor `Error`. (the `Subject` is the same as `name`)

So we are going to set the logic to just check if the `name` field is not empty and let the backend do the work of checking the rules in more detail.

With this in mind we've set the `activeOnFields` as:

[source,php]
----

'activeOnFields' => [
    'type' => ['User'],
    'name' => [
        ['operator' => 'not-empty' ]
    ]
]

----

===== Backend requests triggering

Please have in mind that when we have entries for multiple fields within `activeOnFields`, these conditions work like an `AND`.
Meaning that the logic is only triggered when *all* the conditions are *true*.

In our example the logic is only going to be triggered when the `type` is `User` *AND* the `name` is not empty.

Otherwise, nothing will happen, i.e. no request is going to be made to the backend.

The following gif shows the requests that are done and when.

== 3. Backend Handler


{{% notice note %}}
When making these changes be sure to make them within an extension on the 'extensions' directory, e.g.: 'extensions/<my-extension>/...'
{{% /notice %}}

After defining the logic metadata we need to work on the backend code that is going to handle the requests done.

The `displayTypeBackend` logic uses the `Process` api. The requests done to the `Process` api are handler by php classes implementing the `ProcessHandlerInterface`

In the following example we are going to use the existing `extensions/defaultExt` to add our custom code.


=== 3.1 Steps to add a new process handler to extensions

. Create the folder `extensions/defaultExt/modules/Cases/Service/Fields`
.. This is a best practice not a hard requirement
.. As long as you add under the `extensions/<your-ext>/backend` or `extensions/<your-ext>/modules` it should work.
. Within that folder create the `CaseCalculatePriorityDisplay.php`, i.e. `extensions/defaultExt/modules/Cases/Service/Fields/CaseCalculatePriorityDisplay.php`
.. If you are not using the recommended path, make sure that the `namespace` follows the one you are using
.. On our example the namespace is `namespace App\Extension\defaultExt\modules\Cases\Service\Fields;`
. On `CaseCalculatePriorityDisplay.php` add the code on the snippet on link:./#_3_2_process_handler_implementation[3.2 Process handler implementation] section
. Re-set permissions (may not be needed, this will depend on your configuration)
. Run `php bin/console cache:clear` or delete the contents of the cache folder under the root of the project
. (optional) If you have some kind of php cache like opcache or APCu, you will need to re-start apache.

=== 3.2 Process handler implementation

A class is recognized as a `ProcessHandler` if it implements the `ProcessHandlerInterface`.

Furthermore, for it to be matched with request made by the logic metadata we've defined, it needs the following:

- Set the `ProcessType` to be the same as the value that was defined on the metadata, in this example it is `calculate-priority-display`
- On the response data include a `value` entry that is the value that is going to be used to update the field value on the frontend

The following snippet contains a sample implementation of the process handler for our scenario:

[source,php]
----
<?php

namespace App\Extension\defaultExt\modules\Cases\Service\Fields;

use ApiPlatform\Core\Exception\InvalidArgumentException;
use App\Process\Entity\Process;
use App\Process\Service\ProcessHandlerInterface;

class CaseCalculatePriorityDisplay implements ProcessHandlerInterface
{
    protected const MSG_OPTIONS_NOT_FOUND = 'Process options are not defined';
    protected const MSG_INVALID_TYPE = 'Invalid type';
    public const PROCESS_TYPE = 'calculate-priority-display';

    /**
     * CaseCalculatePriority constructor.
     */
    public function __construct()
    {
    }

    /**
     * @inheritDoc
     */
    public function getProcessType(): string
    {
        return self::PROCESS_TYPE;
    }

    /**
     * @inheritDoc
     */
    public function requiredAuthRole(): string
    {
        return 'ROLE_USER';
    }

    /**
     * @inheritDoc
     */
    public function getRequiredACLs(Process $process): array
    {
        $options = $process->getOptions();
        $module = $options['module'] ?? '';
        $id = $options['id'] ?? '';

        $editACLCheck =  [
            'action' => 'edit',
        ];

        if ($id !== '') {
            $editACLCheck['record'] = $id;
        }

        return [
            $module => [
                $editACLCheck
            ],
        ];
    }

    /**
     * @inheritDoc
     */
    public function configure(Process $process): void
    {
        //This process is synchronous
        //We aren't going to store a record on db
        //thus we will use process type as the id
        $process->setId(self::PROCESS_TYPE);
        $process->setAsync(false);
    }

    /**
     * @inheritDoc
     */
    public function validate(Process $process): void
    {

        $options = $process->getOptions();
        $type = $options['record']['attributes']['type'] ?? '';
        if (empty($type)) {
            throw new InvalidArgumentException(self::MSG_OPTIONS_NOT_FOUND);
        }

        if ($type !== 'User') {
            throw new InvalidArgumentException(self::MSG_INVALID_TYPE);
        }

    }

    /**
     * @inheritDoc
     */
    public function run(Process $process)
    {
        $options = $process->getOptions();

        $type = $options['record']['attributes']['type'] ?? '';
        $name = $options['record']['attributes']['name'] ?? '';

        $value = 'none';
        if (strpos(strtolower($name), 'warning') !== false) {
            $value = 'show';
        }

        if (strpos(strtolower($name), 'error') !== false) {
            $value = 'show';
        }

        $responseData = [
            'value' => $value
        ];

        $process->setStatus('success');
        $process->setMessages([]);
        $process->setData($responseData);
    }
}

==== 3.2.1 Process handler interface methods


**getProcessType()**

In this we need to return the id of our process, the same that is defined on the metadata logic `key` entry. In our example: `calculate-priority-display`

**requiredAuthRole()**

Our process should only be accessed by logged-in users, thus we return `ROLE_USER`;

**getRequiredACLs()**

For new cases, we only want users with `edit` access to the Cases module to be able to call our ProcessHandler. Thus, we defined:

[source,php]
----
        $editACLCheck =  [
            'action' => 'edit',
        ];
----

For already existing cases we need an extra check to make sure that the users has access to that specific record. Therefore, we conditionally add a check for the record id:

[source,php]
----
        if ($id !== '') {
            $editACLCheck['record'] = $id;
        }
----

**validate()**

The ProcessHandler won't be able to do any calculations if the Case `type` is not set. If that happens we should throw an exception:

[source,php]
----
        $type = $options['record']['attributes']['type'] ?? '';
        if (empty($type)) {
            throw new InvalidArgumentException(self::MSG_OPTIONS_NOT_FOUND);
        }
----

And since our business logic states that this should only run if the `type` is `User` we've added another check:

[source,php]
----
        if ($type !== 'User') {
            throw new InvalidArgumentException(self::MSG_INVALID_TYPE);
        }
----

**run()**

This is the method that actually does what the process is supposed to do and returns the appropriate response.

Please have in mind that for the `displayTypeBackend` logic, the response always needs to contain `value` entry like the following:

[source,php]
----
        $responseData = [
            'value' => $value
        ];

        ...

        $process->setData($responseData);
----

==== 3.2.2 Process handler implementation description

Let's take an in depth look at the implementation of our logic, located in the `run()` method.

**Get the input record**

One of the inputs we need for our logic to work is the data in the record.

To get the data sent in the request you can call the `getOptions` method of the process

[source,php]
----
$options = $process->getOptions();
----

The `displayTypeBackend` logic, besides other data, sends the current data on the record.
It sends a `record` entry that follows the standard format for records, the same one that is used on the api to get a record.
The field values of the record are located within the `attributes` entry:

[source,php]
----
$options = $process->getOptions();
$record = $options['record'];
$attributes = $record['attributes'];
----

To get a field on the record we could do (in this example we are getting the 'type'):

[source,php]
----
$options = $process->getOptions();
$record = $options['record'];
$attributes = $record['attributes'];
$type = $attributes['type'];
----


**Calculate the priority display type according to the name**

The rules in our example define that the priority is going to change depending on the value of the name field.
For that we get the value of the name field from the record, then according to its contents we calculate if priority should show or hide.

[source,php]
----
$name = $options['record']['attributes']['name'] ?? '';

$value = 'none';
if (strpos(strtolower($name), 'warning') !== false) {
    $value = 'show';
}

if (strpos(strtolower($name), 'error') !== false) {
    $value = 'show';
}
----

**Set the priority display type**

Finally, for all of this to work we set the display type for the priority on the response data.

[source,php]
----
$responseData = [
    'value' => $value
];

$process->setStatus('success');
$process->setMessages([]);
$process->setData($responseData);
