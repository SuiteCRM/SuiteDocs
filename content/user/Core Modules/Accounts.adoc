= Accounts

The Accounts module is the centralised base from which you can create an
association with most records in SuiteCRM. It is possible to create a
relationship with Contacts, Converted Leads, Opportunities, any Activity
such as Emails or Meetings and Cases. Accounts in SuiteCRM will
typically hold all information specific to a company that your
organisation will have a relationship with. In real world terms an
Account may be a business entity that is a qualified Sales Prospect,
Customer, Supplier or Re-seller and can be used to track all
interactions that take place between these entities and your
organisation.

down or via the Sidebar. The Accounts actions are as follows:

* *Create Account* – Once clicked, a new form is opened in Edit View to

for the Accounts module. This allows you to search and list Accounts
