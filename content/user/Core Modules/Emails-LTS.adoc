= Emails

The Emails module in SuiteCRM allows Users to view, store, compose, send
and receive email from their own personal Email account or a shared
inbox, for example a Support or Sales inbox. Emails can be related to
Accounts, Cases, Contacts and many more records in the CRM.

== Emails Actions

You can access the Emails actions from the Emails module menu drop down
or via the Sidebar. The Emails actions are as follows:

* *View My Email* â€“ Redirects you to your mailbox so that you can view and
manage emails displayed/imported to the CRM.
* *Create Email Template* - A WYSIWYG editor where you can create Emails
by dragging and dropping components, inserting variables and amending
the plain text.
* *View Email Templates* - Takes you to the List View page of your
existing Email Templates. This allows you to search and list Email
Template records.
