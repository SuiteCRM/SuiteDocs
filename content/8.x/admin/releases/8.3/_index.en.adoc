===== Subpanel Filters

When viewing Subpanels, you are now able to filter the results to locate the records you are interested in.
To enable the Filter option, you need to add it via the 'subpaneldefs.php'.  For further information on how to do this,
please see link:../../../features/subpanel-filtering[here.]

===== Load More

Previously in SuiteCRM 8, to view additional records on Listview, Subpanels and Record Modals you would need to use the paging options.

However, you can now choose to 'Load More' meaning the records all display on the one page, making it easier to scroll up
and down the list of records, rather than paging back and forth.

To find out how to switch this on and configure the settings, please see link:../../../features/load-more[here.]
