== Introduction

Starting with version 8.4.2 there is a new security check to see if the host header of the request is a valid one.
This check is performed at the start of every request to the backend.

=== Configuration
This check uses a new entry `trusted_hosts` on `public/legacy/config.php` or `public/legacy/config_override.php`, where you can define an array of regex strings for the trusted hosts, like the following:

[source,php]
----
<?php
...
$sugar_config = array (
...

$sugar_config['trusted_hosts'] = ['^dev\.local$', '^localhost$'];

...

----

=== Default/Fallback
If no `trusted_hosts` entry is defined on `public/legacy/config.php` or `public/legacy/config_override.php`, the system will:

* Parse and use the `site_url` config as one of the entries.
* Add an entry for `localhost`
