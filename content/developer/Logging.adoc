= 11. Logging

== Logging messages

Logging in SuiteCRM is achieved by accessing the log singleton. Accessing
an instance of the logger is as simple as:

.Example 11.1: Accessing the log
[source,php]
LoggerManager::getLogger();



This can then be used to log a message. Each log level is available as a
method. For example:

.Example 11.2: Logging messages
[source,php]
----
LoggerManager::getLogger()->debug('This is a debug message');
LoggerManager::getLogger()->error('This is an error message');
----



This will produce the following output:

.Example 11.3: Logging messages example output
[source,php]
----
Tue Apr 28 16:52:21 2015 [15006][1][DEBUG] This is a debug message
Tue Apr 28 16:52:21 2015 [15006][1][ERROR] This is an error message
----


== Logging output

The logging output displays the following information by default:

.Example 11.4: Logging messages example output
[source,php]
<Date> [<ProcessId>][<UserId>][<LogLevel>] <LogMessage>



`<Date>`::
  The date and time that the message was logged.
`<ProcessId>`::
  The PHP process id.
`<UserId>`::
  The ID of the user that is logged into SuiteCRM.
`<LogLevel>`::
  The log level for this log message.
`<LogMessage>`::
  The contents of the log message.

== Log levels

Depending on the level setting in admin some messages will not be added
to the log e.g if your logger is set to `error` then you will only see
log levels of `error` or higher (`error`, `fatal` and `security`).

The default log levels (in order of verbosity) are:

* `debug`
* `info`
* `warn`
* `deprecated`
* `error`
* `fatal`
* `security`

{{% notice tip %}}
Generally on a production instance you will use the less verbose levels (probably `error` or `fatal`). 
However whilst you are developing you can use whatever level you prefer. 
Developers often prefer the most verbose level - `debug`. 
{{% /notice %}}

== Log file location

The log file, by default, is called `suitecrm.log` and resides in your installation's root directory. 

But you can change log settings through the UI, under link:../../admin/administration-panel/system/#_logger_settings[Admin / System settings / Logger Settings].

== Advanced logging configuration

{{% notice note %}}
The functionality described in this section only applies starting with SuiteCRM version 7.11.14
{{% /notice %}}

Using `sugar_config` entries in `config_override.php` you can get much richer debugging and troubleshooting 
information in your logs. 

=== Filtering log entries

Apart from the control given by the **Log level settings** explained avbove, often you find repetitive 
messages in your logs that don't interest you, and possibly even prevent the relevant messages 
from standing out when you need them. To address this issue, you can filter out undersired messages 
with the configurations shown below.

These are similar to what you would achieve in Linux with `grep`, but have the advantage of giving 
you better control over multi-line log entries.

Be careful with these settings, since hiding log entries can keep you from seeing important messages. 
Normally you will only use these filters temporarily. When not in use, you should ommit these entries entirely.

==== Exclusions
[source,php]
$sugar_config['show_log_regexp_exclude'] = '/css|email/i';

Use a Regular expression with PHP's `preg_match` syntax to specify log lines to exclude from log. 
The above example would exclude lines with either `css` or `email` in them. The final 
`i` flag makes it case-insensitive.

==== Inclusions
[source,php]
$sugar_config['show_log_regexp'] = '/hook/i';

Same as above, but this rule specifies what to include (instead of what to exclude). 
In the example, only lines with `hook` (case-insensitive) will appear.

=== Redirecting PHP messages

When using SuiteCRM, you always have to keep your eye on (at least) two logs: `suitecrm.log` and
the web server PHP log (defined in the `error_log` entry in your `php.ini`, often called `php_errors.log`).
$sugar_config['show_log_with_php_messages'] = true;

Since this duplicity is sometimes inconvenient, and since SuiteCRM now provides much richer log information
and stack traces that the default PHP logger, you can ask SuiteCRM to redirect the PHP messages into
its own log.

[source,php]
$sugar_config['show_log_with_php_messages'] = true;

There are some technical limitations to this possibility, so you might find some kinds of messages
aren't redirected. Also, most will be able to provide the rich stack traces, but not all.

The redirected messages will show up in `suitecrm.log` with a type of `PHP S` ("shutdown" handler) 
or `PHP E` ("error" handler), followed by PHP's severity type, for example:

[source,php]
Thu Apr 16 16:46:26 2020 [9668][1][PHP S] [E_NOTICE] 'Undefined index: item_id' at /cache/smarty/templates_c/headerModuleList.tpl.php (1076)

=== Stack Traces

Often, when a message occurs, it's useful to know which sequence of calls led to that point in the code. 
PHP will provide a stack trace (also know as a "debug backtrace"), and combining several techniques we
are able to enrich these traces with lots of useful information: source code, argument names, argument values, 
even if they're structured types like arrays or objects.

==== Warnings about turning on stack traces

{{% notice warning %}}
Please read this section carefully, it contains important things for your consideration.
{{% /notice %}}

. Using log traces with argument values might leave sensitive information in the system logs, like passwords
and other sensitive data, therefore: 
.. Use it only temporarily for troubleshooting purposes; 
.. Obfuscate the information before posting it online; 
.. Double-check that your logs are only accessible to admins, as they always should. Check that your web server 
is not allowed to serve your log file when somebody accesses `https://your.server.com/suitecrm.log`.
.. Delete the logs when finished troubleshooting.
. Some of these options impact performance (lots of string operations, more file activity) but it's 
always opt-in: the impact only occurs when you configure it to happen. So make sure you turn off the 
more intensive logging options when not needed.

==== Selecting which log messages will display a stack trace

[cols="20s,80a"]
|================================================================ 
|None | 
[source,php]
$sugar_config['show_log_trace'] = false;

The log will not contain any stack traces. The other stack trace options detailed below will be ignored.
Use a boolean, without quotes.

|All |
[source,php]
$sugar_config['show_log_trace'] = true;

Every single log message will contain a stack trace. This can generate a great amount of logging. You 
will probably only consider this setting if you are limiting your logging a lot elsewhere (e.g. through
log level or inclusion filtering).
Use a boolean, without quotes.

|Matching a string|
[source,php]
$sugar_config['show_log_trace'] = 'some string';

Only the log messages matching the provided string will include a stack trace. The string will be matched 
only against the "message" part, i.e. the text provided by the line of code
that produced this log entry. 
A match happens if the provided string appears in any part of the message string, with the exact case.
|================================================================

==== Configuring what is shown about each function call

[cols="20s,80a"]
|================================================================ 
|Single-line versus Multi-line |
[source,php]
$sugar_config['show_log_trace_with_eol'] = true;

A boolean **false** (without quotes) will keep each stack frame in a single line, without line breaks 
(**eol** means "end-of-line").

A boolean **true** (without quotes) will let each stack frame expand across multiple lines. 
This is very convenient when your other settings require a lot of information to be printed. 

|Source code context | 
[source,php]
$sugar_config['show_log_trace_source'] = 1;

Display a portion of the context surrounding the actual source code. 

Using the value **-1** no source code will be displayed (this is the default).

Use **0** to show only the focus line of this frame, with no addtional lines around it. This mostly
repeats the information already present in the frame text, but allows you to see the _actual_ 
arguments (not the _formal_ arguments shown in the frame text).

Use **1** or larger values to show the focus line plus **N** lines on each side, before and after. 

Here is a sample of how the value of **1** displays, with the focus line in the middle marked with **>>**.
[source]
----
   >          $this->setupResourceManagement($module);
   >>         $this->controller->execute();
   >          sugar_cleanup();
----
**Note** that this option will only be effective if you configured the **eol** option above to multi-line.
|Structured arguments depth |
[source,php]
$sugar_config['show_log_trace_depth'] = 7;

When printing the values of arguments in function calls, in each trace line, if the arguments are 
structured, multi-level types, like arrays and objects, then this option lets you define the maximum
level to include. The printing goes on recursively into the objects, and when the level is reached it stops
and shows a `â€¦)` marker.

If this setting is ommitted it will default to **3**.

|Trim Arguments to a maximum length |
[source,php]
$sugar_config['show_log_trace_trim'] = 700;

This is the maximum limit of characters to use when printing each arguments value in each trace line. 

If this setting is ommitted it will default to **100**, which is an appropriate value when 
you opted for single-line stack frames (see above). 

If you're really digging into what is in structured argument values, you migth want to aim for a much 
higher value.

|================================================================

==== Sample stack traces, explained

A single-line stack trace is helpful to understand the basic structure of a trace:

* It starts with a **message** on the first line, and then lists the several **stack frames** of the successive 
function calls that led the code to reach that point;

* each frame then starts with a **`#`** sign, and the frame sequence number,

* then has a **file name**, and a **line number**;

* after the colon (**`:`**) you get the **class name** (if there is one) and a **function or method name**;

* then parentheses will open to list the arguments, each composed of a formal name, a colon and a value.

* if the value is a structured object itself, such as an array or object, a new parentheses will open to start
printing that value's contents. 

* eventually printing may be cut short with a **`â€¦)`** marker, due to the **level** or **trim** limits.

Here is the same stack trace in a more verbose version, with multi-line arguments, source code context, 
and a less stringent trim:

----
This produced a lot more information, as you can see - and only the first trace frames are shown, for brevity. 
Also note that a **larger screen width** is recommended and would allow you to get a lot more clarity 
than what is possible to display here in the Documentation site. 

* The **source code context** of each frame is identified with **`>`** markers, with the **focus line** using 
a double marker (**`>>`**). This is where the function call that produced this stack frame occurred.

* You can see the structured **objects** and **arrays** laid out in indented lines.

All this allows you to get a quick grasp of what SuiteCRM was doing, and which values it was handling, 
at the time the log message occurred.
