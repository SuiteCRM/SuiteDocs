## Usage

- [Visit the documentation](https://learn.netlify.com/en/)

## Download old versions (prior to 2.0.0)

If you need old version for compatibility purpose, either download [theme source code from releases](https://github.com/matcornic/hugo-theme-learn/releases) or use the right git tag. For example, with `1.1.0`

- Direct download way: https://github.com/matcornic/hugo-theme-learn/archive/1.1.0.zip
- Git way:

```shell
cd themes/hugo-theme-learn
git checkout tags/1.1.0
```

For both solutions, the documentation is available at https://github.com/matcornic/hugo-theme-learn/releases/download/1.1.0/hugo-learn-doc-1.1.0.zip

```
git tag <tag>
git push origin <tag>
```
- Generate CHANGELOG.md with gren

```
gren changelog  --override --generate --tags=all
```
- Fix the date for the current release in CHANGELOG.md
- Add the changelog to git and update the tag

```
git add CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "Ship tag <tag>"
git push origin master
git tag -f <tag>
git push --force origin <tag>
```
- Generate release with gren
```
gren release -t <tag>
