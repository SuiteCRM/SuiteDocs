= Search

Searching is a vital aspect within the CRM as this allows you to quickly
define what it is you want to see. Many CRM's will have large data sets
so it is vital to you that you have a way to refine your search. In the
following sub-sections we will cover the various searching options
available to you.

== Global Search

You can search all records within the CRM using the global search
functionality. You can search for records via global search by using the
search bar in the main navigation menu.

Once you have entered your search term, you can press the return key or
click the magnifying glass/search icon. This will return records that
match the search criteria and categorise them by the modules available.

Modules can be added to the global search functionality by the System
Administrator.

== Full Text Search

SuiteCRM has an option to enable or disable a full text global search.
The full text global search is powered by
http://framework.zend.com/manual/1.12/en/zend.search.lucene.overview.html[Zend
Lucene] search framework. The search works very similar to the standard
global search, but provides the enhanced functionality of searching text
in documents and other files, compared to the record-level search
provided by the standard global search.

The search returns results slightly different to global search. Results
are returned in order of score. Records are scored dependent on how well
you match the search criteria provided by you â€“ from 0-100%.

== Basic Module Search

Basic search is available on all modules within the CRM. Basic search,
as standard, allows users to search on the record name.

Basic search also allows users to check the 'My Items' check box.
Enabling this option will only return records that are assigned to you.

Once a user has searched for a record, the search will be saved. This
means that you can navigate to records and other modules within the CRM
but the search will not be cleared. If you wish to clear your search,
you can click btn:[Clear] and then click btn:[Search]. This will clear any saved
searches and return to the default result set for that module.
