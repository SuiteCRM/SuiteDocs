== 1. Introduction

Display logic allows you to define rules to hide and show panels/tabs depending on field values.

=== 1.1 Example scenario

As an example we will hide the `More Information` tab on Accounts if the Name is `Example`.

== 2.Logic Metadata definition


The first thing to define is the `displayLogic` entry in the metadata. This is where we are going to define the triggers for hide/display our panel.

The configuration for the logic can be added only to `detailviewdefs.php`.

When adding this code be sure to add it below `newTab` within the `tabDefs`.

In the following example we are going to add them to the `Accounts` module `detailviewdefs.php`.


=== 2.1 Steps to add the logic on the custom detailviewdefs.php

. Copy the core Accounts `detailviewdefs.php` to the custom folder:
.. From: `public/legacy/modules/Accounts/metadata/detailviewdefs.php`
.. To: `public/legacy/custom/modules/Accounts/metadata/detailviewdefs.php`
. Replace the `LBL_PANEL_ADVANCED` entry on the custom `detailviewdefs.php` with the code on the snippet below
** Re-set permissions if needed (will depend on your setup)
. Run `Repair and Rebuild` on Admin menu


[source,php]
----
    'LBL_PANEL_ADVANCED' =>
        [
            'newTab' => true,
            'panelDefault' => 'expanded',
            'displayLogic' => [
                'hide_on_name' => [
                    'key' => 'displayType',
                    'modes' => [
                        0 => 'detail',
                        1 => 'edit',
                        2 => 'create',
                    ],
                    'targetDisplayType' => 'hide',
                    'params' => [
                        'fieldDependencies' => [
                            'name'
                        ],
                        'activeOnFields' => [
                            'name' => [
                                'Example'
                            ],
                        ],
                    ],
                ],
            ],
        ],

=== 3. Properties Description

* Key
- The `key` within the named `displayLogic` array is stating which logic type will be used for the following.
In this case it's `displayType`.

* Modes
- Modes are views you would like your `required` logic to take effect on, as shown above it will be `detail`, `edit` and `create`.
Another example of a `mode` that could be selected could be `list` for example.

==== Field Dependencies

`fieldDependencies` is where you declare the field(s) that you would like your logic to depend on.

[source,php]
----
'fieldDependencies' => [
    'name',
]
----

==== Active on Fields

`activeOnFields` is where you declare the field/values that trigger the change of the tab to be shown/hidden.

In the example above we have the tab `More Information` to hide when name is `Example`.

If we wanted it to hide if it was either `Example` or another value such as `User` then a new value would be added like so:

[source,php]
----
'activeOnFields' => [
  'name' => ['Example', 'User'],
],
----

image:Hidden-Tab-Name-User.png[Hidden Tab - Name User]

==== Target Display Type

`targetDisplayType` should be either `show` or `hide`.

If you have a tab you would like to hide until a field has a certain value, you can add `'display' => 'hide'`:

[source,php]
----
    'LBL_PANEL_ADVANCED' =>
        [
            'newTab' => true,
            'display' => 'hide',
            'panelDefault' => 'expanded',
            'displayLogic' => [
                'hide_on_name' => [
                    'key' => 'displayType',
                    'modes' => [
                        0 => 'detail',
                        1 => 'edit',
                        2 => 'create',
                    ],
                    'targetDisplayType' => 'show',
                    'params' => [
                        'fieldDependencies' => [
                            'name'
                        ],
                        'activeOnFields' => [
                            'name' => [
                                'Example',
                            ],
                        ],
                    ],
                ],
            ],
        ],
