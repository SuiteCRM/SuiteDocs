= Cases

In SuiteCRM Cases are used to record interactions with Customers when
they ask for help or advice, for example in a Sales or Support function.
A Case can be created, updated when a User is working on it, assigned to
a colleague and closed when resolved. At each stage of the Case the User
can track and update the incoming and outgoing conversation thread so a
clear record of what has occurred is registered in the CRM. Cases can be
related to individual records such as Accounts, Contacts and Bugs.
