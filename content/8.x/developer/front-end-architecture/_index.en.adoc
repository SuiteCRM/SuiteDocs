== 1. Architecture overview

SuiteCRM's front end architecture was designed with the following concepts in mind.

. Keep a standard design and approach accross the app
** Aim to have a very standard UI, with the same look and feel across the app
** Aim for maximum component re-usage and develop similar features using the same components
. Configuration driven
** Aim to be backend configuration driven as much as possible.
*** Allows for easier customizations
*** Front-end extensions are complex and hard to develop
** No module specific features.
*** If a module has a specific feature it should be developed in a configurable way. Allowing it to be re-used
. Extensible
** Aim to allow extending / overriding all components and services

== 2. Front-end structure

SuiteCRM front end components are split into some categories according to their goal.

A good way to start is to have a look at the `app-core` structure in `core/app/core`.
It can provide a high level understanding of how the project is structured and of the existing concepts.

While `directives`, `pipes`, `services` and `components` are well known angular concepts. Some of the other may not be that obvious to understand at a first glance.
In the next sub-chapters we are going to give a high level intro to the concepts behind some of these parts.

== 2.1 Views

Views is a well known concept in SuiteCRM since way back. Each view represents a page.
In the new front-end architecture they structure and control all subcomponents in given page.

The following images can help provide a better idea of what a view is on the page.

Views could be defined as:

. The Main component for a page
. Always linked to a route in the router
** Thus should always be accessible through a route
. Can load and control data for a record
** Done using the concept of stores
. Control display state for other components in the view
. Can not be re-used within other views or components


== 2.2 Components

Components are the well know components in angular.
However in SuiteCRM there are some extra distinctions

Components could be defined as:

. Represent a ui re-usable component
** they must be re-usable within any other component
. Display only
** Data-wise, they are considered dumb.
** Components only display data they don't change it control it
** If a component triggers an action or does something that data changes, they do not contain any of the business logic to handle that. They just notify the parent view / container and that action should be handled by the parent
. Components can call/use other components


Good examples of components are:

* buttons
* panels
* image component
* label component

== 2.3 Fields

Fields follow the same concept that know to SuiteCRM since way back.
They represent a field in a record.
A field has a type and is displayed differently depending on that type.


Components could be defined as:

. Represent a field in the record
. Can be displayed in modes: `edit`, `create`, `detail`, `list`, `massupdate`, `filter`, and other that may come
. Can change the way they display depending on metadata
. They can display and update data

The following image can help give a better understanding

== 2.4 Containers

Containers are very similar to views. Each can load and manage data and each also have and control subcomponents.
Though there is a big difference is: Containers are re-usable. Containers can be called within other views and aren't linked to a route.

Containers could be defined as:

. Representing a set of data: a record, a list, etc.
** Can load and control data for a record
. Their data fetching is not tied to the view's data fetching.
. They are never linked to a route in the router
. Control display state for their subcomponents components
. Can have several instances in a single view


Good examples of containers are:

* Subpanels
* Record selection modals
* Sidebar widgets
* Top widgets

The image we've seen previously can help give a better understanding
