== 1. Example of Display Field Logic

In this example we are going to see how to add field logic in order to show how to hide fields based on another field's values.

**How to hide a field**

As an example of how to hide a field, we are going to add configurations to the `phone_office` field on the Accounts Module.
The configuration we add will set the field to hide when the Account Name is `Example`.

== 2. How does this look as Code?

The following code block shows an example of the above configuration

----
<?php

...
'name' => 'phone_office',
'comment' => 'The office phone number',
'label' => 'LBL_PHONE_OFFICE',
'displayLogic' => [
        'hide_on_name' =>
            [
                'key' => 'displayType',
                'modes' => [
                    'detail',
                    'edit',
                    'create',
                ],
                'params' => [
                    'fieldDependencies' => [
                        'name',
                    ],
                    'targetDisplayType' => 'none',
                    'activeOnFields' => [
                        'name' => ['Example'],
                    ],
                ],
            ],

...
----

When adding this configuration, it can be added to the `vardefs.php` or the `detailviewdefs.php`.

When adding this code be sure to add it below the field name and label as shown above.

=== Display Logic

Within `displayLogic` for specific fields you can set multiple definitions. Each definition will work like an `OR`.
For example:

----
<?php
...

    'hide_on_name' => [
        'key' => 'displayType',
        'modes' => ['detail', 'edit', 'create'],
        'params' => [
            'fieldDependencies' => [
                'name',
            ],
            'targetDisplayType' => 'none',
            'activeOnFields' => [
                'name' => ['Example']
            ]
        ]
    ],
    // OR
    'hide_on_website' => [
        'key' => 'displayType',
        'modes' => ['detail', 'edit', 'create'],
        'params' => [
            'fieldDependencies' => [
                'website',
            ],
            'targetDisplayType' => 'none',
            'activeOnFields' => [
                'website' => [ ['operator' => 'is-empty' ] ]
            ]
        ]
    ],
...
----

This means that if `Name` is `Example` the field will hide or if `Website` is empty then the field will also hide.

=== Properties description

* Key
- The `key` within the named `hide_on_name` array is stating which logic type will be used for the following.
In this case it's `displayType`.

* Modes
- Modes are views you would like your `displayLogic` to take effect on, as shown above it will be `detail`, `edit` and `create`.
Another example of a `mode` that could be selected could be `list` for example.

==== Params

===== Field Dependencies
`fieldDependencies` is where you declare the field(s) that you would like your logic to depend on.

----

<?php

...
'fieldDependencies' => [
    'name',
    'website'
]

...

----

==== Active on Fields

`activeOnFields` is where you declare the field/values that trigger the change of the field to a shown/hidden field.

In the example above we have the field `phone_office` hide when name is `Example`.

If we wanted it to hide if it was either `Example` or another value such as `User` then a new value would be added like so:

----
<?php
...
'activeOnFields' => [
  'name' => ['Example', 'User'],
],
...
----

image:Hidden-Phone-Field-User.png[Hidden Phone Field]

===== Multiple Fields

Within the `activeonFields` you can add more than one field such as:

----
<?php
...

'activeOnFields' => [
  'name' => ['Example'],
  'website' => ['www.google.com', 'www.yahoo.com' ]
],

...
----

This works like an AND. If Name is `Example` AND Website is either `www.google.com` or `www.yahoo.com`.

image:Shown-Phone-Field-Example.png[Name Example Shown]

image:Hidden-Phone-Field-N-W.png[Name and Website Example]

When adding more fields to `activeOnFields` be sure to also add them to `fieldDependencies`

===== With operators

When using operators on `activeonFields` you can use the operator once, or multiple times within the same field to meet specific criteria.

----
<?php

...
'activeonFields' => [
    'website' => [ ['operator' => 'is-empty'] ]
]

...
----

====== Multiple Operators

----
<?php
...

'activeonFields' => [
    'employees' => [
    //AND
    [
        'operator' => 'greater-than',
        'value' => 5
    ],
    [
        'operator' => 'less-than',
        'value' => 25
    ],
    [
        'operator' => 'not-equal',
        //OR
        'values' => [15, 20]
    ],
    ['operator' => 'not-empty'],
]

...
----

In the example above if `employees` is:

* Greater than 5
* Less than 25
* Not equal to 15 or 20
* Has a value

Then the field will hide from the view.

An example using the code above on the Accounts `Industry` Field:

image:Shown-Field-Industry-Employees.png[Industry Example Shown]

image:Hidden-Field-Industry-Employees.png[Industry Example Hidden]

====== Using Fields as Comparison

When using operators you can use another field for the comparison. For example (within Opportunities):

----
<?php

'activeonFields' => [
    'amount' => [ ['operator' => 'less-than', 'field' => 'probability'] ]
]

...
----

If `amount` is less than `probability` then the chosen field will hide from display.

You can find more information on the different operators link:../../operators/[here.]

==== Target Display Type

`targetDisplayType` will either be `none` or `show`.

`None` will hide the field if conditions are met and `Show` will display the field.
