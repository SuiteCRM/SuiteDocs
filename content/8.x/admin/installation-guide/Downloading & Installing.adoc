{{% notice info %}}
The following documentation is for SuiteCRM Version 8+; to see documentation on the same topic for Version 7, click link:../../../../admin/installation-guide/downloading-installing[here].
{{% /notice %}}


== 1. Setup your webserver for SuiteCRM

{{% notice note %}}
The following documentation will use as base setup a LAMP stack: Linux, Apache, MySql and php. However, most of the steps may apply to other webservers and databases
{{% /notice %}}

=== 1.1 Install required software

Install the platform-appropriate version of the following:

* webserver: `apache`
* `php`
* database: `mysql` or `mariadb`

See the link:../../compatibility-matrix/[Compatibility matrix] to ensure you have the correct versions of the required softwares.

{{% notice note %}}
there are other software dependencies on the link:../../compatibility-matrix/[Compatibility matrix], however those are the ones required for a development environment.
{{% /notice %}}

When installing SuiteCRM from pre-build installable package zip you **do not** need to install the dependencies that are for development, namely: node, angular cli, yarn/npm.

The SuiteCRM 8 pre-built installable  package zip comes with the pre-built front end files under `public/dist` and all the required libs on vendors.


==== Helpfull Resources

=== 1.2 Install required php modules

Install on your server the required php modules:

* cli
* curl
* common
* intl
* json
* gd
* mbstring
* mysqli
* pdo_mysql
* openssl
* soap
* xml
* zip
* imap (optional)
* ldap (optional)

==== Helpfull Resources

Please check the `Helpfull Resources` section from link:#_1_1_install_required_software[Install required software] for instructions on how to install php modules

=== 1.3 Configuring URL re-writes

In order for api routes to work you need allow url re-writes.

* All SuiteCRM-Core api calls depend on this (calls to `api/graphql`) if re-rewrites are not allowed you will get a `404` when calling the api.

In `apache` webserver this can be achieved by enabling mod-rewrite and configuring the vhost.

{{% notice note %}}
It is highly recommended that you update the webroot or configure vhost to point to the `public` folder inside SuiteCRM folder. If the webroot is pointing to SuiteCRM folder instead of the public folder, all the files under SuiteCRM folder maybe be exposed to the web.
{{% /notice %}}


On your vhost configuration you need something like:

[source,xml]
----
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ...

    DocumentRoot /<path-to-suite>/public
    <Directory /<path-to-suite>/public>
        AllowOverride All
        Order Allow,Deny
        Allow from All
    </Directory>

</VirtualHost>
----

* link:https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-mod_rewrite[DigitalOcean - Tutorial on how to setup mod_write (apache),window=_blank]
** Note from the above you would only need:
*** Section 1â€”How to Activate Mod_Rewrites
*** How to permit changes in the .htaccess file:

=== 1.4 Configure php error_reporting

Please make sure that notices aren't considered on `error_handling`. For that you can update the error handling entry in `php.ini`

[source,ini]
----
error_reporting = E_ALL & ~E_DEPRECATED & ~E_STRICT & ~E_NOTICE & ~E_WARNING
----


==== Helpfull Resources

Please check the `Helpfull Resources` section from link:#_1_1_install_required_software[Install required software] for instructions on where to find `php.ini`


=== 1.5 (optional) (recommended for production) Enable op cache

Enabling op cache will greatly improve performance. Though its only recommended for production environments.

To enable op cache you have to enable and configure it on php.ini.

* The following example is based on the Symfony documentation that you will find in the `Helpfull resources`

[source,ini]
----

[opcache]
; Determines if Zend OPCache is enabled
zend_extension=opcache.so
opcache.enable=1

; The OPcache shared memory storage size.
opcache.memory_consumption=256

; The maximum number of keys (scripts) in the OPcache hash table.
; Only numbers between 200 and 100000 are allowed.
opcache.max_accelerated_files=20000

; When disabled, you must reset the OPcache manually or restart the
; webserver for changes to the filesystem to take effect.
opcache.validate_timestamps=0
----

== 2. Downloading and Setting up SuiteCRM

=== 2.1 Downloading the latest SuiteCRM files

Unless you want to setup a development environment, you should download the pre-built installable packages available for download on link:https://suitecrm.com[suitecrm.com,window=_blank]

See the link:../../releases/8.0/[SuiteCRM 8 releases page]

=== 2.2 Copy the files to your webserver root

After you download the package

. Unzip the pre-build installable package.
. Copy the the files to your web server web root.

For `apache` webserver the web root is usually under `/var/www` or `/var/www/html`

{{% notice note %}}
Please consider the `DocumentRoot` you have set on your vhost (if using apache). See link:#_1_3_configuring_url_re_writes[1.3 Configuring URL re-writes]
{{% /notice %}}

{{% notice note %}}
Adding the files to the web root is the most typical install method, but you can have different setups, like subdomains and others.
{{% /notice %}}



=== 2.3 Set permissions

Set the required permissions

If you are using the terminal you can do this by running:

[source,bash]
----
find . -type d -not -perm 2755 -exec chmod 2755 {} \;
find . -type f -not -perm 0644 -exec chmod 0644 {} \;
find . ! -user www-data -exec chown www-data:www-data {} \;
chmod +x bin/console
----

Please have in mind that:

* The user and group name (in the above example `www-data`) needs to be replaced by the actual system user and group that your webserver runs under. This varies depending on your
operating system. Common web server users are as follows:
** `www-data` (Ubuntu Linux/Apache)
** `apache` (Linux/Apache)

* If the group name differs from the username apache is running with, you may need `0664` instead of `0644`, and `2775` instead of `2755`

=== 2.4 (optional) Creating the database

Depending on your setup, you maybe required to create the database before you go through the install process.

The install process will then create the needed tables.

'''

== 3. Running the installer

From SuiteCRM version 8 and above you have two ways to run installer:

. link:#_3_1_option_1_installing_using_the_install_page[3.1 Option 1: Installing using the install page]
. link:#_3_2_option_2_installing_using_the_cli[3.2 Option 2: Installing using the cli]

Following you can find documentation on how to install using the web installer or the cli.

=== 3.1 Option 1: Installing using the install page

To run the web installer go to `https://<your-suite-crm-instance-path>/`

Since you are not installed this should re-direct you to `https://<your-suite-crm-instance-path>/#/install`

Where you should see a view like the following

image:web-ui-install-license.png[web-ui-install-license.png]

==== 2.1.1 Accept the license

In order to be able to install you'll have to accept the license by checking the `I ACCEPT` checkbox.

==== 2.1.2 Setup basic system configuration

The next step is to add the base system configuration in order for your system to work.

image:web-ui-install-configuration.png[web-ui-install-configuration.png]

{{% notice note %}}
On this page apart from `Ignore system check warnings` all fields are required and need to be set a value.
{{% /notice %}}

In this tab you will find the following configurations:

==== 2.1.2.1 URL OF SUITECRM INSTANCE

image:web-ui-install-url.png[web-ui-install-url.png]

In the above field you should set the url where your SuiteCRM instance is located. A few example:

* `https://example-domain.com`
* `https://localhost`
* `https://crm.example-domain.com`

**Tip: ** you can simply copy the url from you browser's address bar

==== 2.1.2.2 SuiteCRM Database User

image:web-ui-install-db-user.png[web-ui-install-db-user.png]

In the above field you should set the user name for accessing your database.

{{% notice note %}}
Ensure that the Database Administrator you specify has the permissions to create and write to the SuiteCRM database.

image:web-ui-install-db-user-password.png[web-ui-install-db-user-password.png]

In the above field you should set the password for accessing your database.


==== 2.1.2.4 Host Name

image:web-ui-install-db-host.png[web-ui-install-db-host.png]

In the above field you should set the host of your database.

{{% notice note %}}
In some systems when using `localhost` doctrine will try to use socket connection. However, socket connection is not supported at the moment, so in such cases, its maybe best to try with the ip, e.g. `127.0.0.1`
{{% /notice %}}

==== 2.1.2.5 Database Name

image:web-ui-install-db-name.png[web-ui-install-db-name.png]

In the above field you should set the name you want for the databases that will be created on your host during the install process, e.g. `suite` or `suitecrm` or another valid db name.

==== 2.1.2.6 Database Port

image:web-ui-install-db-port.png[web-ui-install-db-port.png]

In the above field is set to the default port user in `mysql` and `mariadb` database engines. You should only change it in case your database host is using a different port.

==== 2.1.3 Ignoring install warnings

image:web-ui-install-ignore-warnings.png[web-ui-install-ignore-warnings.png]

Before running the install process, SuiteCRM is going to check for some system requirements, like `max upload file size` or `memory limit`. Some of these checks are optional, meaning that you can install the system without those.
In case you want to proceed with the installation even if there are warnings you can check the `Ignore System Check Warnings` checkbox

==== 2.1.4 Run the install

After you have accepted the license and set correct values for all the configurations you can click on `Proceed`.

This is going to trigger the install process.
As explained before the install process will first check for some system requirements.

If there any errors during the validation, the install process will halt and a modal will open with a description of the checks that failed.

If all the checks passed the system will continue on to the install process. During the install process you will see a loading spinner on the page. This process can take some time.

After the install process finishes you will be re-directed to the login page.


==== 2.1.5 Double-checking configurations

Please double-check that the following configurations are correct

*1* - Legacy config in public/legacy/config.php

* `site_url`:
** if you don't have your vhost pointing to the `public` dir within your SuiteCRM 8 root folder, you should append `/public` to your current host
*** e.g. if your address is something like `https://your-host/crm/public`,

*2* - .htaccess in public/legacy/.htaccess

* `RewriteBase`
** If you have your vhost pointing to `legacy` dir within the SuiteCRM 8 root folder. Then the correct value is `RewriteBase /legacy`
** Otherwise, you should prepend the path until the `public` folder.
*** e.g. if your address is something like `https://your-host/crm/public`, then the correct value is `RewriteBase /crm/public/public`


==== 2.1.6  Access the app

Try to login into your instance


=== 3.2 Option 2: Installing using the cli


==== 3.2.1 Install the system

* Run command:
