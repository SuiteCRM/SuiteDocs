To overcome the issues mentioned above, you need to apply the following change on your code base.

parameters:
  upgrades:
    toKeep:
      - 'cache'
      - 'extensions'
      - 'public/extensions'
      - 'public/legacy/modules'
      - 'public/legacy/custom'
      - 'public/legacy/cache'
      - 'public/legacy/upload'
      - 'public/legacy/Api/V8/OAuth2/private.key'
      - 'public/legacy/Api/V8/OAuth2/public.key'
      - 'public/legacy/config.php'
      - 'public/legacy/config_override.php'
      - 'public/legacy/config_si.php'
      - 'public/legacy/suitecrm.log'
      - 'public/legacy/install.log'
      - 'logs'
      - '.env.local'
      - '.env.local.php'
      - 'tmp'
    toExpand:
    
    ...
----

*3* - Run:

* For dev mode run: `composer install`
* For prod mode run: `composer install --no-dev --prefer-dist --optimize-autoloader`

==== 2. Download the RC package

*1* - Create the following folder on you current instance: 

* `<your-suitecrm-8-root-folder>/tmp/package/upgrade`

*2* - Download the SuiteCRM 8 RC pre-built / installable package

*3* - Place the package on the `<your-suitecrm-8-root-folder>/tmp/package/upgrade` folder

*4* - If needed re-set the correct permissions.

==== 3. Run the upgrade command

*1* - On your SuiteCRM 8 instance root run: `./bin/console suitecrm:app:upgrade -t "<version>"`

* Where `<version>` is the name on the SuiteCRM 8 RC package
