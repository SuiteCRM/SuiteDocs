== Providing a Bug Fix

* To provide a code contribution for an issue you will need to set up
your own fork of the SuiteCRM repository, make your code changes, commit
the changes and make a Pull Request to the appropriate branch on the
SuiteCM repository. See our
link:../forking/[Quick Guide to Fork SuiteCRM]. Once you have set up your forked repository you can
begin making commits to the project.

* When creating a PR to SuiteCRM, you should always direct it to the `hotfix` branch.
* When creating a PR to SuiteCRM 8 you should also direct it to the `hotfix` branch.

{{%notice info%}}The hotfix branch will then be merged into develop which, in turn, will be merged into `master`.{{%/notice%}}

* Separate each issue fix into a new branch in your repository and name it with the issue
ID e.g. _bugfix_3062_ or _issue-1234_.
+
e.g. to create the branch from `hotfix` with the following git command:
+
`git checkout -b _bugfix_3062_ upstream/hotfix`
+
e.g. for SuiteCRM 8 this would also be:
+
`git checkout -b _bugfix_3062_ upstream/hotfix`

* When committing to your individual bugfix branch, it helps to follow
the message format below:
+
`Fix #1234 - <the subject of the issue>`
+
e.g of a commit command
+
`git commit -m "Fix #1436 - Reports with nested Parentheses are removing parameters"` +
+
This commit message format allows us to easily include all bug
fixes within major and minor *Release notes*.
+
If you are new to Writing Commit Messages in git follow the guide
http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rules[here].

* When pushing a branch that has been created from an upstream branch
to your remote fork, you will need to specify "origin", e.g.
+
`git push origin _bugfix_3062_`

=== Changing your Pull Request from 7.10.x to hotfix

As of the 31st January 2022 extended support for 7.10.x has ended. However, that does not mean that the Pull Request you
created to fix a specific issue or to add a feature is not still applicable!

If the issue you face is still present in 7.12.x but your Pull Request is for 7.10.x there are some steps below showing
how you can point your Pull Request towards the `hotfix` branch.

1. Checkout your branch that has the intended fix.
`git checkout <your-branch>`

2. Get the hash for the first commit you made from the branch then work your way through until the most recent via:
`git log -1 --format=format:"%H"`
+
When using the command above, in order to get the hashes from all commits you have made to the branch, you must change
the number `1` to how many commits you have made.

3. Checkout the hotfix branch.
`git checkout hotfix`

4. Checkout a new branch that you will then update the PR to.
`git checkout -b <new-branch>`

5. Cherry-pick your commits across.
`git cherry-pick commit1 commit2`
+
`commit1` will be replaced with the hash's from your commits.

When pushing up a new branch with the same changes as a previous PR made, please reference the newly created Pull Request
in the old Pull Request and then close.

However, if you feel comfortable with git, and you are able to then you can re-push to the same branch and change the base
branch on the PR to hotfix providing you have rebased.

=== Make a Bug Fix Pull Request

* After you have made your commits and pushed them up to your forked
repository you then create a
http://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/[Pull Request] to be
reviewed and merged into the SuiteCRM repository. Make a new Pull
Request for each issue you fix â€“ *do not* combine multiple bugfixes into
one Pull Request.

* Ensure that in your Pull Request that the base fork is
*salesagility/SuiteCRM* and base branch is `hotfix`.
For SuiteCRM 8 ensure that the base fork is
*salesagility/SuiteCRM-Core* and the base branch is `hotfix`.
with the head fork being *your repository* and a base branch of your unique bugfix branch e.g. _bugfix_1234_

* We will automatically reject any Pull Requests made to the wrong
branch!

=== CLA Check

If you have not signed our https://cla.suitecrm.com/salesagility/SuiteCRM[CLA] (Contributor License Agreement) then your Pull Request will fail a check
and won't be able to be merged into the project. You will only be required to sign
this once.

=== Travis CI

When a new Pull Request is opened, Travis CI will test the merging of
the origin and upstream branch and update the Pull Request. If this
check fails you can review the test results and resolve accordingly. To
test prior to making a Pull Request install PHPUnit via composer into
your develop environment then cd into the tests directory and run:

`sh runtests.sh`
