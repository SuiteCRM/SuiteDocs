== 2. Installing using the install page

To run the web installer go to `https://<your-suite-crm-instance-path>/`

Since you are not installed this should re-direct you to `https://<your-suite-crm-instance-path>/#/install`

Where you should see a view like the following

In order to be able to install you'll have to accept the license by checking the `I ACCEPT` checkbox.

The next step is to add the base system configuration in order for your system to work.

{{% notice note %}}
In some systems when using `localhost` doctrine will try to use socket connection. However, socket connection is not supported at the moment, so in such cases, its maybe best to try with the ip, e.g. `127.0.0.1`

==== 2.2.5 Database Name

image:web-ui-install-db-name.png[web-ui-install-db-name.png]

In the above field you should set the name you want for the databases that will be created on your host during the install process, e.g. `suite` or `suitecrm` or another valid db name.

==== 2.2.6 Database Port

image:web-ui-install-demo-data.png[web-ui-install-demo-data.png]

In the above field you can set if, during the install process, you want to pre-populate your database with demo data.

image:web-ui-install-admin-username.png[web-ui-install-admin-username.png]

In the above field you can set the username for your SuiteCRM instance's administrator user, e.g. `admin` or any other username you want to give.

image:web-ui-install-admin-password.png[web-ui-install-admin-password.png]

In the above field you can set the password for your SuiteCRM instance's administrator user.

=== 2.3 Ignoring install warnings

image:web-ui-install-ignore-warnings.png[web-ui-install-ignore-warnings.png]

Before running the install process, SuiteCRM is going to check for some system requirements, like `max upload file size` or `memory limit`. Some of these checks are optional, meaning that you can install the system without those.
In case you want to proceed with the installation even if there are warnings you can check the `Ignore System Check Warnings` checkbox

=== 2.4 Run the install

After you have accepted the license and set correct values for all the configurations you can click on `Proceed`.

This is going to trigger the install process.
As explained before the install process will first check for some system requirements.

If there any errors during the validation, the install process will halt and a modal will open with a description of the checks that failed.

If all the checks passed the system will continue on to the install process. During the install process you will see a loading spinner on the page. This process can take some time.

After the install process finishes you will be re-directed to the login page.


=== 2.5 Double-checking configurations

Please double-check that the following configurations are correct

*1* - Legacy config in `public/legacy/config.php`

* `site_url`:
** if you *do not* have your vhost pointing to the `public` dir within your SuiteCRM 8 root folder, you should append `/public` to your current host
*** e.g. if your address is something like `https://your-host/crm/public`,

*2* - `.htaccess` in `public/legacy/.htaccess`

* `RewriteBase`
** If you have your vhost pointing to `legacy` dir within the SuiteCRM 8 root folder. Then the correct value is `RewriteBase /legacy`
** Otherwise, you should prepend the path until the `public` folder.
*** e.g. if your address is something like `https://your-host/crm/public`, then the correct value is `RewriteBase /crm/public/legacy`


=== 2.6  Access the app

Try to login into your instance
