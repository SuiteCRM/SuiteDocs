== Providing a Bug Fix

* To provide a code contribution for an issue you will need to set up
your own fork of the SuiteCRM repository, make your code changes, commit
the changes and make a Pull Request to the appropriate branch on the
SuiteCM repository. See our
link:Contributing_to_SuiteCRM#Quick_Guide_to_Fork_SuiteCRM[Quick Guide
to Fork SuiteCRM]. Once you have set up your forked repository you can
begin making commits to the project.

* First, determine which base branch your bug fix should use. If your
bug is present in both `hotfix` and `hotfix-7.8.x` then use the `hotfix-7.8.x`
branch. If however, your bug is specific to hotfix, then you can use the
hotfix branch.

* Separate each issue fix into a new branch in your repository (Either
from the `hotfix-7.8.x` or `hotfix` branch) and name it with the issue
ID e.g. _bugfix_3062_ or _issue-1234_.

* When committing to your individual bugfix branch, it helps to follow
the message format below:
+
`Fixed #1234 - <the subject of the issue>`
+
e.g of a commit command 
+
`git commit -m "Fixed #1436 - Reports with nested Parentheses are removing parameters"` + 
+
This commit message format allows us to easily include all bug
fixes within major and minor link:Release_notes_7.6[release notes].
+
If you are new to Writing Commit Messages in git follow the guide
http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rules[here].

=== Make a Bug Fix Pull Request

* After you have made your commits and pushed them up to your forked
repository you then create a
http://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/[Pull Request] to be
reviewed and merged into the SuiteCRM repository. Make a new Pull
Request for each issue you fix – *do not* combine multiple bugfixes into
one Pull Request.

* Ensure that in your Pull Request that the base fork is
*salesagility/SuiteCRM* and base branch is either `hotfix` or
`hotfix-7.8.x` with the head fork being *your repository* and a base
branch of your unique bugfix branch e.g. _bugfix_1234_

* We will automatically reject any Pull Requests made to the wrong
branch!

=== CLA Check

If you have not signed our
https://www.clahub.com/agreements/salesagility/SuiteCRM[CLA]
(Contributor License Agreement) then your Pull Request will fail a check
and won't be able to be merged into the project. You will only be required to sign
this once.

=== Travis CI

When a new Pull Request is opened, Travis CI will test the merging of
the origin and upstream branch and update the Pull Request. If this
check fails you can review the test results and resolve accordingly. To
test prior to making a Pull Request install PHPUnit via composer into
your develop environment then cd into the tests directory and run:

`sh runtests.sh`
