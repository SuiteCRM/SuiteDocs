When making these changes be sure to make them in the custom directory, ie: 'public/legacy/custom/modules/<module>/...'

== 1. Introduction

UpdateValue logic allows you to define rules to set a value on a field when other fields' value change

{{% notice info %}}
At the moment this does not work for relate fields
{{% /notice %}}

=== 1.1 Example scenario

In this example we will be updating the value of Account's employees field when the value of industry field changes.

== 2. Logic Metadata definition

The first thing to define is the `logic` entry in the metadata. This is where we are going to define the triggers for our value update.

The configuration for the logic can be added to the `vardefs.php` or the `detailviewdefs.php`.

In the following example we are going to add them to the `Accounts` module field vardefs.

=== 2.1 Steps to add the logic on the custom vardefs

. Create a new field in custom extensions for Accounts module:
.. Example:  `public/legacy/custom/Extension/modules/Accounts/Ext/Vardefs/employees.php`
. Copy the 'employees' definition from `public/legacy/include/SugarObjects/templates/company/vardefs.php`
. Replace the `logic` entry to the  `employees` definition with the code on the snippet below
** Re-set permissions if needed (will depend on your setup)
. Run `Repair and Rebuild` on Admin menu


[source,php]
----
<?php

$dictionary['Account']['fields']['employees'] = array(
    'name' => 'employees',
    'vname' => 'LBL_EMPLOYEES',
    'type' => 'varchar',
    'len' => 10,
    'comment' => 'Number of employees, varchar to accomodate for both number (100) or range (50-100)',
    'logic' => [
        'update-value' => [
            'key' => 'updateValue',
            'modes' => ['detail', 'edit', 'create'],
            'params' => [
                'fieldDependencies' => [
                    'industry',
                ],
                'targetValue' => '450',
                'activeOnFields' => [
                    'industry' => ['Banking'],
                ]
            ]
        ],
    ]
);
----


=== 3. Update Field Value Logic

Within `logic` for specific fields you can set multiple definitions for `update-value`. Each definition will work like an `OR`.
For example:

[source,php]
----

    'name' => 'employees',
    'comment' => 'Number of employees, varchar to accomodate for both number (100) or range (50-100)',
    'label' => 'LBL_EMPLOYEES',
    'logic' => [
        'update-value' => [
            'key' => 'updateValue',
            'modes' => ['detail', 'edit', 'create'],
            'params' => [
                'fieldDependencies' => [
                    'industry',
                ],
                'targetValue' => '450',
                'activeOnFields' => [
                    'industry' => ['Banking'],
                ]
            ]
        ],
        // OR
        'update-value2' => [
            'key' => 'updateValue',
            'modes' => ['detail', 'edit', 'create'],
            'params' => [
                'fieldDependencies' => [
                    'industry',
                ],
                'targetValue' => '5000',
                'activeOnFields' => [
                    'industry' => ['Media'],
                ]
            ]
        ],
    ]
----

Now, Employees will update to 450 if the Industry is `Banking` OR 5000 if Industry is `Media`.

=== 4. Properties description

* Key
- The `key` within the named `logic` array is stating which logic type will be used for the following.
In this case it's `updateValue`.

* Modes
- Modes are views you would like your `updateValue` logic to take effect on, as shown above it will be `detail`, `edit` and `create`.
Another example of a `mode` that could be selected could be `list` for example.

==== 4.1 Params

===== Field Dependencies

`fieldDependencies` is where you declare the field(s) that you would like your logic to depend on.

[source,php]
----
'fieldDependencies' => [
    'industry',
]
----

==== Active on Fields

`activeOnFields` is where you declare the field/values that trigger the change of the field to a required field.

In the example above we have the field `employees` set to 450 when Industry is Banking.

If we wanted it to set it to 450 if it was either Banking or another value such as Media, then a new value would be added like so:

[source,php]
----
'activeOnFields' => [
  'industry' => ['Banking', 'Media'],
],
----

===== Multiple Fields

Within the `activeonFields` you can add more than one field such as:

[source,php]
----
'activeOnFields' => [
    'industry' => ['Banking'],
    'name' => ['Example'],
],
----

This works like an AND. If Name is `Example` AND Industry is `Banking`.

When adding more fields to `activeOnFields` be sure to also add them to `fieldDependencies`.

==== Target Value

`targetValue` will be the value you want the field to have if criteria is met.

In the example above it was `450`.
