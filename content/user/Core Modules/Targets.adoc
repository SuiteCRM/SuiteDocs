= Targets

Typically Targets are used as the recipients of a Marketing Campaign,
your organisation knows very little about these individuals and they may
be re-used for new Campaigns or deleted without any impact to the
business. Your organisation will spend little resources on Targets and
will usually be contacted en masse. Targets can be acquired from
purchased email lists or gathered from trade shows your organisation has
been present. The Targets module in SuiteCRM is used to store and manage
information about these individuals.

== Targets Actions

You can access the Targets actions from the Targets module menu drop
down or via the Sidebar. The Targets actions are as follows:

* *Create Target* – A new form is opened in Edit View to allow you to
create a new Target record.
* *View Targets* – Redirects you to the List View for the Targets module.
This allows you to search and list Target records.
* *Import Targets* – Redirects you will be taken to the Import Wizard for
the Targets module. For more information, see
link:./../../introduction/user-interface/#_importing_records[Importing Records].

When importing Targets, at the final step of the Wizard you will be given an option to add 
all imported Targets to a Target List of your choice.
