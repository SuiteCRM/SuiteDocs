=== Apache2 Server

Those who have upgraded from an older version of SuiteCRM, will need to
run the `rebuild .htaccess` tool. As the API uses "friendly" urls to
define resources. It may be possible to use the API without this
feature. However, you will want the .htaccess file to configure the
`/api` entrypoint to the `lib/API/public` folder.

*The Mod Rewrite Apache2 Module must be installed and configured.*

=== IIS Server

IIS Server Administrators will need create a web.config file manually
configure the `/api` entrypoint to the `lib/API/public` folder.

*It is important to ensure that the `lib/API/OAuth2/` directory cannot be
accessed over a HTTP request.*

=== Configure Encryption Keys
Provided that the file permissions enable your web server to write to `lib/API/OAuth2/` folder, 
SuiteCRM will attempt to auto-generate the keys in this location.

==== Generating public and private keys manually

To generate the private key run this command on the terminal:

`cd /path/to/instance/lib/API/OAuth2`

`openssl genrsa -out private.key 1024`

`openssl rsa -in private.key -pubout -out public.key`
