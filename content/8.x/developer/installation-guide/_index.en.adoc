== Quick Start Guide
For System Requirements see the compatibility matrix link:../../admin/compatibility-matrix[here]

=== Pre-Installation

. Setup php, mysql and apache

{{% notice note %}}
Please make sure that your `apache` has `mod_rewrite` enabled and that it is properly configured to allow for re-writes.
All SuiteCRM-Core api calls depend on this (calls to `api/graphql`) if re-rewrites are not allowed you will get a `404` when calling the api.

. Install composer
. Install node and npm
. Install angular cli
. Install yarn: (https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)

=== Installation

. Run `composer install` in the root directory
. Run `yarn install` in the root directory
. Run legacy theme compile in the root directory
    - *NOTE:* the `./vendor/bin/pscss` is added as a composer dev dependency, so you need to run `composer install` *without* `--no-dev`
+
[source,bash]
----
./vendor/bin/pscss -s compressed ./public/legacy/themes/suite8/css/Dawn/style.scss > ./public/legacy/themes/suite8/css/Dawn/style.css
----

    - *NOTE:* Pre beta 2 steps
    ** On SuiteCRM 8 Beta 2 version the legacy composer.json file has been aligned and unified into the Suite 8 composer.json file.
    ** Hence, from Beta 2 onwards there is only one composer file under `{Suite 8 Root}/composer.json`.
    ** For SuiteCRM 8 versions prior to Beta 2 you need to:
    *** Run `composer install` in legacy directory (`/public/legacy`)
    *** Run legacy theme compile in the legacy directory (`/public/legacy`)
    **** *NOTE:* the `./vendor/bin/pscss` is added as a composer dev dependency, so you need to run `composer install` *without* `--no-dev`
    ****`./vendor/bin/pscss -s compressed themes/suite8/css/Dawn/style.scss > themes/suite8/css/Dawn/style.css`

. Set permissions (though these may need to be different depending on your setup)
+
[source,bash]
----
find . -type d -not -perm 2775 -exec chmod 2775 {} \;

find . -type f -not -perm 0644 -exec chmod 0644 {} \;

find . \! -user www-data -exec chown www-data:www-data {} \;

chmod +x bin/console
----

. Run `yarn run build:common` or `yarn run build-dev:common` (for dev environment)
. Run `yarn run build:core` or `yarn run build-dev:core` (for dev environment)
. Run `yarn run build:shell` or `yarn run build-dev:shell` (for dev environment)

. Run `composer dumpautoload`

. Go back to suite8 root folder
. Run `./bin/console suitecrm:app:install` (or pass on the options, e.g. -u <admin_username>)
    - **Note:** before running the command make sure to create the database (the command will create the needed tables)

. Re-set permissions on Suite 8 root folder

+
[source,bash]
----
find . -type d -not -perm 2775 -exec chmod 2775 {} \;

find . -type f -not -perm 0644 -exec chmod 0644 {} \;

find . \! -user www-data -exec chown www-data:www-data {} \;

chmod +x bin/console
----
